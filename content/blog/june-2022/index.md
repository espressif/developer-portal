Hi everyone,

Last month (21–23 June), Espressif Systems was delighted to participate in the 20th edition of embedded world. With over 3,900 online and onsite attendees *embedded world* proved that it is the leading trade fair of the international embedded community. More than 720 exhibitors from 39 countries presented their latest developments in embedded technologies, ranging from components, modules and complete development boards to operating systems and software tools, as well as services for embedded systems.

In this major event, Espressif unveiled ESP32-C5, the world’s first RISC-V SoC with a dual-band Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5 (LE) connectivity. We also presented the most recent achievements in our SoC portfolio. Here are some more details about them:

- [ESP32-C5](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-C5): a RISC-V SoC with 2.4 & 5 GHz Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5 (LE), which is designed for IoT applications requiring high-efficiency wireless transmissions;
- [ESP32-H2](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32_H2): a RiSC-V SoC that combines IEEE 802.15.4 (Thread and Zigbee) and Bluetooth 5 (LE) with support for the Matter protocol, which enables interconnectivity for home-automation projects from different providers;
- [ESP32-C2](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs) and [ESP32-C3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c3): RISC-V SoCs with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 4 and Bluetooth 5 (LE) connectivity, designed for a wide range of common IoT products;
- [ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3): An AI SoC built specifically for the AIoT market. It combines 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 4 and Bluetooth 5 (LE) with powerful AI acceleration and reliable security features for high-performance applications of voice and face recognition.

Furthermore, from 20 to 23 June 2022, the CSA Connectivity Standards Alliance held [a members’ meeting](https://csa-iot.org/event/alliance-member-meeting/) in San Diego, USA, where professionals from across the globe came together to develop Alliance standards, through networking and collaboration across multiple working groups. Espressif, as an active member of the CSA Alliance and among the first contributors to the Matter project, was there showcasing its [one-stop Matter solution](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP_Matter_Solution). This is based on a whole range of Espressif SoC series, a production-ready [ESP-Matter SDK](https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter), and ESP RainMaker’s Matter integration, which enables Cloud-based management for Matter devices.
