Hi everyone,

Espressif is taking part in the [Smart Home Expo](https://www.smarthomeexpo.in/why-smart-home-expo.php) next month in Mumbai, India, which will take place at the Jio World Convention Centre, on 20–21 April 2022. The Smart Home Expo is India’s largest comprehensive trade show and conference that demonstrates the best smart-home technology from across the globe. With over 100+ brands, the exhibition is bound to be an action-packed event featuring the latest market trends, game-changing smart-home technology, live demos, new product launches, technical seminars, as well as exciting new opportunities. The Smart Home Expo in 2022 will also showcase automation technology for offices and hotels.

Espressif Systems’ participation in the Smart Home Expo will showcase our brand as a one-stop, AIoT solution-provider of not just innovative hardware evidenced by our various series of SoCs, but also of SDKs, Firmware, Cloud backend, phone apps, and voice integrations. The main products we want to highlight in this exhibition are [ESP32-C3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c3) (our single-core Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth 5 LE SoC based on the open-source RISC-V architecture), [ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3) (our dual-core XTensa LX7 MCU with AI capabilities), and [ESP RainMaker](https://rainmaker.espressif.com/) (our complete system for building AIoT products).

More specifically, through our participation in the Smart World Expo we want to address customers who are aware of our ESP32 series of SoCs but use third-party Cloud services. We want these people to know more about ESP RainMaker, our own Cloud offering, and its many advantages including the use of customers’ own private cloud with a pay-as-you-grow economic plan, with easy adoption and deployment, best-in-class data security, voice-integration support, as well as full ownership and platform control.

So, those of you who will be in Mumbai on 20–21 April 2022 do come to Espressif’s stall and say “hi” to our representatives there. They will be more than happy to explain all about our innovative AIoT solutions.
