Dear all,

2019 has been an eventful year for Espressif; we went [IPO](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_IPO) and we launched the new [ESP32-S](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/socs) series of chips that enable making secure, connected devices with high performance at affordable cost.

We also worked on improving the security of our existing systems. [ESP32v3](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32_FIA_Analysis) (aka ESP32 ECO3, the updated version of ESP32) patched the hardware vulnerabilities that were uncovered by the works of our security consultants and later independently by “LimitedResults” (aka “LR”). We thank them for the work on ESP32; Espressif has been and will always be transparent about any security issues. The security of our systems is also constantly reviewed by the best security professionals of our industry, and we spare no effort to fix any issues that comes up. To our customers, we reaffirm our commitment to provide the best support for both our old and new products alike.

Espressif is about building the best user experience. For this, we have built the most comprehensive ecosystem for IoT developers, including our flagship [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/index.html) SDK, application frameworks: [ESP-JUMPSTART](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-jumpstart/en/latest/introduction.html) and ESP-RAINMAKER, [ESP-SKAINET](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/software/esp-skainet/overview) for AI enabled offline voice commands engines, [ESP-WHO](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who) for AI enabled face recognition solutions, development boards, and modules.

As you can see, we are not just about creating the best Wi-Fi chips, but also about providing to our customers complete and fully customizable solutions that work right out of the box. We also understand that connected product development and maintenance needs to be simplified without compromising flexibility. Try our latest [ESP32-S2](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s2_datasheet_en.pdf) based ESP-RAINMAKER development boards that enable you to build the a complete cloud connected product within a couple of hours.

In 2020, we will be launching 4 new chips, covering different segments of the market, price points and performance. Our latest chips feature our new radio architecture that has lower power consumption while maintaining the same -40°C~125°C performance. The peripherals have been upgraded with highly sensitive capacitive touch IO’s. Capacitive touch controls are now a staple of user interfaces because they are cost efficient; certain functions such as slider controls are better supported with capacitive touch than with analog implementations.

Recently there has been an unfortunate coronavirus epidemic in China. We have taken measures to work around the restrictions caused by the situation and as a result, based on our current assessment of the situation, the disruption to our operations will be minimal. We and our suppliers are expected to resume operations on the 10th of February. Our teams in Europe, India and China continue in our work to best serve our customers. Should you have any questions or requests, please do write to our business team at [sales@espressif.com](mailto:sales@espressif.com).

Lastly, we thank our supporters, commercial customers and makers. IoT is a powerful technology that can be used to create solutions that could solve the pressing issues of our time and we continue to believe in our open source approach, robust and low cost solutions that can help everyone develop applications seamlessly.

Happy coding!

Best regards,

Teo Swee Ann

CEO, Espressif Systems
