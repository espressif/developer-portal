The daily schedule of the conference is divided into four sections lasting two hours each. Every presentation is allocated a 30-minute slot which will comprise a talk and a five-minute Q&A session at the end of it. A 15-minute break will follow each two-hour section. At the end of each day, we will have a __15-minute General Q&A session__  for any questions from the audience. This will be handled by __Espressif’s Director of Technical Marketing Amey Inamdar, and Senior Director of Engineering Kedar Sovani at the end of the first day at 19:30 CEST.__  The General Q&A session at the end of the second day will be handled by __Espressif’s VP of Software Platforms Ivan Grokhotkov at 19:45 CEST.__  Then, at the end of the entire conference, __Espressif’s Developer Advocate and Conference Organiser Pedro Minatel will share with us his closing remarks at 20:00 CEST.__  We will kick off our conference with none other than __Espressif’s Founder and CEO, Teo Swee Ann, who will deliver his welcome speech__ . Teo Swee Ann needs no special introductions. He established Espressif in 2008 and __his name has become synonymous with technological innovation ever since.__  It is always interesting to listen to what he has to say. __Our second keynote speaker is going to be our VP of Software Platforms Ivan Grokhotkov, who will talk us through all the new features of ESP-IDF v5.0., at 10:00am on Thursday, 21 October.__
