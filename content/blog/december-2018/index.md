Welcome to our December Newsletter

Hi everyone,

As original equipment manufacturers work to squeeze more functionality onto cheaper and smaller IoT devices, they face a series of challenges in development and operations. This whole process results in security vulnerabilities, inefficient code, compatibility issues and unclear licensing. [One of the sessions at the recent AWS re:Invent 2018](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=91580) revolved around the ways in which Amazon FreeRTOS makes building, deploying and updating connected microcontroller-based devices easier, quicker and more economical, while retaining confidence that these devices are secure.

Espressif’s Director of Technical Marketing, [Amey Inamdar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amey-inamdar-2b00561/), was at AWS re:Invent 2018 and [spoke about an IoT solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fNFKYAuHls) developed with the help of Amazon FreeRTOS and Pentair, a leading water treatment company. Moreover, the session introduced the OTA and BLE support that has been recently added to Amazon:FreeRTOS. Amey talked about three particular aspects (Security, OTA and Openness) for building connectable products, and how the ESP32 port of Amazon FreeRTOS helps in this regard.

In fact, this month’s newsletter explores a bit further, in a separate article, how Espressif’s ESP32-based development boards support BLE in [a:FreeRTOS](https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/), thus making Espressif one the first platform providers to do so.

Other news you can read in our December newsletter include: an article about the Paris-based software vendor, MicroEJ, which utilizes ESP32 dev boards to provide a secure platform for designing compact-sized and low-power IoT products with a rich set of features and an improved user experience; Espressif’s presence in Macnica’s booth at the 2018 “electronica”, the biggest international trade fair and conference for electronics, which took place in Munich a couple of weeks ago; and, last but not least, the ultimate Christmas gift, the ESPaper Calendar, based on ESP8266 and developed by ThingPulse!

November was a productive month for Espressif, leading to exciting IoT solutions, collaborations and events. We hope that you can feel our inexhaustible enthusiasm about IoT and AI technology, as it is manifested through our work and the news we are delivering about it in our December newsletter. The calendar year is drawing to a close and we cannot help but reflect on our accomplishments in 2018, thinking that this year has marked one of the most fulfilling, challenging and successful chapters in Espressif’s ten-year history. So, we’ll leave you with an optimistic mood about the future, sending season’s greetings and wishes for a merry Christmas to those of you who celebrate it.

Best wishes, John Lee.

At the end of last month, [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) announced the beta version of Amazon FreeRTOS BLE, a feature that makes it possible for embedded developers to securely connect [ESP32 dev boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/development-boards), or other a:FreeRTOS devices that use Bluetooth Low Energy, to AWS IoT through Android or iOS devices. ESP32 provides one of the first few platforms supporting the BLE feature in a:FreeRTOS.

[MicroEJ](http://www.microej.com/) is a Paris-based software vendor of cost-effective solutions for embedded IoT devices. It seems that [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/)’s collaboration with MicroEJ was only a matter of time, since both companies are committed to providing secure products in markets where software applications require high performance, compact size, energy efficiency and cost-effective development.

The 2018 “[electronica](https://electronica.de/)”, an international trade fair and conference for electronics, took place in Munich last month and [Espressif’s latest series of products](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware) were presented by [Macnica](https://www.macnica.eu/node/261), Espressif’s distributor in Europe. This was one of the most important events in the electronics industry, as more than 3,100 exhibitors from over 50 countries provided an insight into the electronics of the future with their solutions and products. It was the biggest gathering in the history of this event which is held in Munich every two years since 1964.

## The ESPaper Calendar App

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*OidDttMAdImtc2EV.jpg)

Christmas is fast approaching and we couldn’t think of a better gift than the ESPaper Calendar App from [ThingPulse](https://thingpulse.com/). Recently, Marcel and Dani have been hard at work to deliver a new application for their 2.9" ESPaper Plus Kit, the [ESPaper Calendar](https://calendar.espaper.com/). It lets you manage shared resources such as meeting rooms and shared desks by connecting it to a cloud calendar.
