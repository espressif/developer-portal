Hi everyone,

We are really happy about the successful outcome of the webinar we jointly organised with Amazon Web Services this month. It was an online event which took place on Tuesday, 27 October 2020. The main objective of this webinar was to demonstrate how to build voice-interactive products with AVS Integration for AWS IoT Core, using Espressif’s [ESP32-Vaquita-DSPG](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-Vaquita-DSPG_and_SDK) development kit.

As we all know, Alexa-based voice-interactive solutions have become a mainstream way for controlling IoT devices. With the advent of Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Integration for AWS IoT Core, low-power, low-cost microcontrollers have started playing a significant role in creating connected devices with Alexa built-in capabilities. So, in our webinar we showed participants how a solution based on Espressif’s ESP32-Vaquita-DSPG development kit, in conjunction with the rich set of Amazon Web Services, can be used to simplify building Alexa-based voice-interactive devices.

More specifically, we talked about AVS Integration for the AWS IoT Core protocol, the hardware and software system architecture that is based on ESP32-Vaquita-DSPG, the engineering efforts required to build voice-controlled devices, the ways in which users can accelerate development and manage deployment nowadays, and finally the manufacturing and certification issues that should always be taken into consideration.

Our webinar was addressed to Technical Decision Makers in Engineering, Solution Architects, Product Managers of voice-enabled products, Engineers of Embedded Hardware/Software, and Cloud Engineers. Indeed, the audience we attracted on the day was truly diverse, enthusiastic and keen on learning more about the technological solutions we presented. We were delighted to welcome all of them to an event that was both fun and useful, while we also look forward to continuing our collaboration with AWS on all fronts.
