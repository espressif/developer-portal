Happy New Year everyone!

Warmest wishes from all of us here at Espressif. May the new year bring you health, happiness and creativity! In 2019 Espressif will continue its expansion in the field of Artificial Intelligence, while also taking its IoT solutions to the next level. Our intention is to continue working hard and remain at the forefront of technological evolution.

We said goodbye to 2018 in the best possible way, having received a technological-breakthrough award in December, as a top-10 startup company in Shanghai. The award ceremony took place during a conference about technological achievements in 2018, which was organized by the Shanghai Science & Technology Innovation Center with the support of the local government.

So, we’re welcoming 2019 full of energy and hope, as we’re heading to Las Vegas for this year’s [Consumer Electronics Show (CES)](https://www.ces.tech/), the world’s biggest event for companies conducting business in the consumer technologies sector. At the 2019 CES we’ll showcase, among others, the Amazon FreeRTOS-qualified ESP32, the Espressif HomeKit SDK, ESP-Mesh, ESP-ADF, Conversational User Interfaces and Alexa on ESP32. At the same time, we’ll be holding several business meetings with clients and potential partners, aiming to familiarize them with our latest solutions in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things.

We hope these topics can convey a sense of the variety of products and services that Espressif intends to deliver during 2019. Our company aims to expand the range of its products even further, reach new and bigger markets, and deliver innovative solutions to more people across the world. At the core of these strategic goals are always our customers, our partners and our supporters.

Nothing would be possible without your continuing support.
