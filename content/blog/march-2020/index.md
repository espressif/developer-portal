Hi everyone,

As the COVID-19 crisis spreads rapidly all around the world our thoughts are with those who keep fighting the global pandemic. Now that the epicenter of infections has moved westward, we want to send a message of hope from China to all our partners, our customers and our international community of supporters. __Things will get better!__ 

In China, life is gradually getting back to normal. Further to what Espressif’s __CEO and Founder, Teo Swee Ann__ , said in a recent [blog post](/blog/a-ceos-experience-during-the-covid-19-crisis-part-iii-looking-ahead), we are now happy to confirm that Espressif in China functions normally and at full capacity. But we have more reasons to be excited about. As we mentioned last month, __ESP32-S2 is in mass production now__ . [We have been working for this moment for many years](/blog/esp32-s2-is-here), as we wanted to offer a Wi-Fi-enabled MCU targeting connected, low-cost, low-power, interactive sensors with numerous [advantageous features](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s2_technical_reference_manual_en.pdf).

Additionally, we are particularly moved to witness members of __the international maker community__ using their creativity and technical skills to __respond to the COVID-19 crisis__ . __Many of the solutions they suggest are based on our SoCs and this makes us even happier!__ Hence, we decided to dedicate most of this month’s newsletter to presenting their solutions.

So, the topics you can read about in this month’s newsletter include:

- Espressif’s new ESP32-Vaquita-DSPG development kit and its accompanying SDK, both of which support AVS integration with the AWS IoT Core;
- An ESP8266-based, low-cost, contactless, do-it-yourself, infrared thermometer which can contribute to the fight against the spread of the novel coronavirus;
- An ESP8266-based, distance monitor that can help you properly maintain the official guidelines for social distancing during the COVID-19 crisis;
- ESP8266-based gadgets that can track the development of COVID-19 in different countries;
- In Italy, Gabriele Merlonghi, a maker and Espressif supporter, turned to the power of ESP8266, in order to fuel his creativity and uplift his young son’s spirits during the global pandemic.
