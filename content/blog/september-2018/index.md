Hi everyone,

It seems that the scorching heat of summer in Shanghai has only fueled our fervor for improving our IoT solutions! We have been hard at work releasing ESP-IDF v3.0.3. This bugfix update is compatible with all apps written for ESP-IDF v.3.0.x. The changes are related to Bluetooth, LWIP, Wi-Fi, System, and Driver. You can check the entire list of changes [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/tag/v3.0.3), while you can have a look at the [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/) for all the installation instructions.

Additionally, we have recently released [ESP Mesh](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/software/esp-mesh/overview), our latest solution to achieving stable and secure Wi-Fi coverage across big spaces. With ESP Mesh, a Wi-Fi hotspot expands to a whole network with many more nodes than in traditional networks. Furthermore, ESP Mesh is a “self-healing” and automatically formed network, which makes it significantly more stable.

At the same time, Microsoft announced that its Azure IoT Workbench has started supporting Arduino development on ESP32. This is integrated into Microsoft Visual Studio, while also supporting OTA updates from, and data-processing in, the Microsoft Azure cloud. For more information, you can see Microsoft’s announcement [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/iotdev/2018/08/13/azure-iot-workbench-now-supports-esp32-devices/).

On a different note, the 2018 IoT Bootcamp by iBHubs in India, which was partially sponsored by Espressif, came to a grand closure last month. This event comprised ten comprehensive bootcamps on IoT, which received a huge response from 110 institutions

Espressif always tries and supports important events in the international maker community. One of them is [PyCon AU](https://2018.pycon-au.org/), Australia’s national conference for the Python Programming Community. This year it took place in Sydney on August 24th — 28th. Espressif was delighted to be part of this event by sponsoring the one-day mini-conference that was dedicated to the Internet of Things. This [event](https://2018.pycon-au.org/internet-of-things-track/)included presentations and demonstrations of how Python powers IoT devices, applications and services.

Zerynth is a middleware for IoT and Industry 4.0 solutions. It speeds up IoT development and enables Python for microcontrollers. In recent weeks, Zerynth has been publishing some really interesting articles focused on ESP32-based devices. For instance, their CW02 development board is based on Espressif’s [ESP32-WROOM-32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp-wroom-32/overview) module.

WiFiBoy32 is a portable game console and IoT DevKit based on Espressif’s [ESP32-WROOM-32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp-wroom-32/overview)module. The platform also features a pair of 8-pin GPIOs, along with SPI, DAC, I2S, ADC, and VP/VN connections. It also sports six large gaming/multi-purpose buttons, select and start buttons, as well as Program/Reset buttons, a micro USB, and a 2.4-inch (240 x 320) color SPI TFT LCD display.

A new project presented on[hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/159811-esp32-wiphone) has piqued our interest. It is an open-source phone which has been made for placing and transmitting telephone calls over the Internet. It is based on an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview)microprocessor and runs a type of software that is compatible with Arduino. The ESP32-WiPhone measures approximately 120mm x 65mm x 12mm and has a 2.4” LCD screen.
