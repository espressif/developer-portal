Hi everyone,

An exciting IoT contest has just been launched by [Amazon Web Services (AWS) on hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/contests/Healthy-Spaces-with-AWS). It is entitled “Reinventing Health Spaces” and the challenge for developers across the world is to build an open-source, healthy-spaces solution using M5Stack Core2 for the AWS IoT EduKit reference hardware, AWS IoT Core, and at least one other cloud service. We, at Espressif, are particularly happy about this event, because the AWS IoT EduKit is based on [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32). AWS IoT EduKit also works seamlessly with [ESP RainMaker](https://rainmaker.espressif.com/), as is mentioned in the EduKit’s [Getting-Started guide](https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/getting-started/run-rainmaker.html).

As the contest organizers have put it: “The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a spotlight on the importance of public health and safety. […] As cities begin to open back up and people can gather once again in homes, businesses, and public spaces, it’s more important than ever to have strong safety protocols and continue innovating new solutions that keep us safe. These may include temperature screenings, physical distancing guidelines, face-covering requirements, occupancy limits, and enhanced cleaning and air flow. Technology can clearly play a role in reinventing how we keep people healthy by making it easier to follow safety protocols and best practices”.

So, we can’t wait to see what the community will invent!

All submissions must include an article on the Hackster website about your entry for the competition, open-source code, and either images or a short video demonstrating your solution. The deadline for submitting it to the contest is August 15, 2021, at 8:00pm Pacific Time. Winners will be announced on August 31, 2021. To get all the details about the “Reinventing Healthy Spaces” contest, you can check out the [relevant article on hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/contests/Healthy-Spaces-with-AWS).

Connecting two [ESP32 SoCs](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) via a serial connection, attaching an external (Wi-Fi) antenna to each of them, and tucking them away in a pretty enclosure opens up a number of [interesting opportunities](https://thingpulse.com/product/espgateway/).
