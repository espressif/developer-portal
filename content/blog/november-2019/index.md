Hi everyone,

At the beginning of November, a fun project posted on hackster.io put us in the mood to take Halloween seriously! “[Doris, the Evil Bowler Hat with ESP32 Matrix Voice](https://www.hackster.io/matrix-labs/doris-the-evil-bowler-hat-w-esp32-matrix-voice-a8cf86)” was created by Samreen Islam, Alfred Gonzalez and Carlos Chacin. They used an Open embeddeD Audition System (ODAS) and customized code to move a servo motor in the direction of the most concentrated incoming sound around a 180-degree radius.

This enabled the hat to face anyone who would be speaking to the person wearing it! Then, an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview)on the MATRIX Voice was used for controlling an 8x8 LED MATRIX via SPI with eye animations, which created a fun and spooky effect. Finally, 3D-printed spidery legs completed the look of the evil bowler hat! You can find all the details about this project by clicking [here](https://www.hackster.io/matrix-labs/doris-the-evil-bowler-hat-w-esp32-matrix-voice-a8cf86).

Congratulations to all three members of the team who created this project. Here, at Espressif we value good team work and believe it is the essence of any kind of success.

Other topics you can read in this month’s newsletter include:

Rui Santos from Random Nerd Tutorials recently posted a very interesting entry on his blog. It shows [how to build a web server with the ESP32-CAM board](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-take-photo-display-web-server/) that allows you to send a command to take a photo and visualize the latest captured photo in your browser, having saved it first in SPIFFS.
