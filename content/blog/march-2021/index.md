Hi everyone,

Have you noticed the newest addition to our services? We are very excited about enriching our set of customer services with *free-of-charge* reviewing services for circuit diagrams and PCB designs of products powered by Espressif’s chips and modules. We have added this to our existing customer services, in order to ensure the technical accuracy of Espressif-powered products and their conformity to our high-quality standards.

So, if you would like us to make sure that your self-designed, Espressif-based product achieves optimal performance, please provide us with its circuit schematic and PCB design for a technical review. Together with this, you should also [fill in and submit the relevant online form](https://www.espressif.com/en/contact-us/circuit-schematic-pcb-design-review). Then, our experienced team of engineers will carry out this review. Rest assured they will come up with suggestions specifically tailored to your product, while also paying particular attention to the confidentiality that this process entails.
