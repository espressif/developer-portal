Hi everyone,

RISC-V Days Tokyo is Japan’s largest live online RISC-V event, featuring presentations, virtual demo booths, and an online press conference. RISC-V Days Tokyo aims to bring together leading RISC-V technologies and products, key persons and engineers, while providing business opportunities for product recognition, collaboration among companies, and exchange of information among industry experts. Last year’s event attracted a total of 1,053 participants from 11 countries.

This year’s event took place on 22–23 April and, of course, Espressif was there. On 22 April 2021, Espressif’s Senior Software and Technical Marketing Manager, Jeroen Domburg, made a presentation of ESP32-C3, which is Espressif’s recently released, RISC-V-based Wi-Fi+Bluetooth LE SoC. With more than twenty years of experience in embedded systems, Jeroen is involved with both the software and the hardware design process of Espressif’s microcontroller units. Thus, Jeroen discussed the technical specifications of ESP32-C3, which is a SoC intended for IoT connectivity with WiFi and Bluetooth LE. The launch of this chip has also marked Espressif’s first SoC with a RISC-V processor at its core and, therefore, Jeroen talked about our experience of changing over to a RISC-V-based solution.
