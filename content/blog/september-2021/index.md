Hi everyone,

A few weeks ago, the [Bluetooth SIG Blog](https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/how-espressif-built-a-bluetooth-mesh-to-unlock-the-infinite-potential-of-the-iot/) interviewed Teo Swee Ann, Espressif Systems’ founder and CEO, who shared his insight into the current and future use cases of Espressif’s open-source Bluetooth mesh protocol stack. [ESP-BLE-MESH](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf/esp-ble-mesh) is widely used across smart-home, smart-lighting, and smart-industry environments.

“The most common use case for our [Bluetooth® mesh solution in the smart lighting market](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/use-cases/lighting-control/?utm_campaign=connected-lightings&utm_source=internal&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=how-espressif-leverages-bluetooth-mesh-to-unlock-the-infinite-potential-of-the-iot) is connecting the lighting equipment using the Bluetooth mesh topology. This can be implemented effectively in home, enterprise, industrial, or public environments”, said Teo Swee Ann. Regarding the role of Bluetooth mesh in the future of smart lighting, he added: “Based on current market data, we anticipate [an increase in the penetration of Bluetooth® mesh in the smart lighting market](https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/why-bluetooth-technology-is-lighting-the-way/). For example, combining Bluetooth [AoA/AoD technology](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/recent-enhancements/direction-finding/) with Bluetooth mesh will enable indoor positioning through lighting networks that will facilitate various consumer and business-oriented use cases, such as asset tracking. With the ability of Bluetooth mesh to provide device-to-device communication and connect to the internet via a gateway, more smart-lighting systems will be developed.”

Teo Swee Ann, then, went on to talk about potential future applications of the Bluetooth mesh technology: “Through the combination of Bluetooth mesh, voice-and-image recognition, smart home sensors, and machine learning, technology will adapt to human needs even better, improving the quality of everyday life even further.” To read the whole of Teo Swee Ann’s interview, click [on the picture below](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/how-espressif-built-a-bluetooth-mesh-to-unlock-the-infinite-potential-of-the-iot).
