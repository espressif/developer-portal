Hi everyone,

Earlier this week, the news about the upcoming release of ESP32-C3, Espressif’s single-core, RISC-V-based, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE 5.0 MCU, took the online maker community by storm. We’re delighted to know that so many people are eager to find out more about Espressif’s new products! That’s why we’re including in this month’s newsletter [a comprehensive article](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32_C3) about ESP32-C3 along with the relevant [datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c3_datasheet_en.pdf).

ESP32-C3 is, of course, part of our [MINI series](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32_S2_MINI_series) of modules, which we announced back in August 2020, as you might remember. So, here’s some more news about the MINI series: the engineering samples of ESP32-S2-MINI-1/1U, ESP32-MINI-1 and ESP32-PICO-MINI-02 are now available on [Espressif’s official sample provider webpage](https://www.espressif.com/en/contact-us/get-samples). Make sure you order your samples today, so you can start working on your new ESP projects as quickly as possible!

Also, if you’re getting into a Christmassy mood already, you can order a couple of more samples and give them to your maker friends as a gift. We can guarantee they will love them! __Espressif’s MINI series__  of modules are __an ideal choice__  for a wide variety of application scenarios relating to the __Internet of Things, wearable electronics and smart home__ .

On a different note, [IOT2TANGLE’s hackathon](https://i2t.medium.com/the-integrate-everything-with-iota-hackathon-is-live-872636cc3ff8) that Espressif System sponsored along with other IoT companies was calling for the best IoT/IOTA integrations until November 25th at 11:59 PM CET.

We’re really excited that dozens of registered projects have been submitted by __contestants from all around the world__ , e.g. from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Peru, Switzerland, the United States, and many other countries. [This hackathon, entitled “Integrate Everything with IOTA”](https://youtu.be/BI_p3Bg7ZGE), aims to generate quality open-source integrations that will be valuable stepping-stones for subsequent development projects that connect IoT devices with Distributed Ledger Technologies.

__*Good luck to all the participants!*__
