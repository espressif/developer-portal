Hi everyone,

May has been a busy and exciting month for all of us at Espressif! Our 2020 online and offline courses, based on [ESP-Jumpstart](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP_Jumpstart), have just been released. These courses are part of our outreach program for [Chinese graduates and final-year College students ](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6D_JKP0AX-dWZDvMzV6Hug)who are interested in pursuing an engineering career. We want to introduce them to the world of engineering through ESP32, while showing them the diverse career opportunities the Espressif is able to offer. In response to our uncertain times, the online part of our program has been especially designed as an all-inclusive learning opportunity for Chinese graduates either within the country or abroad, since their physical presence is not required for the completion of the course.

We believe that [ESP-Jumpstart](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-jumpstart/en/latest/introduction.html) is the ideal platform for our outreach program, because it simplifies the process of building ESP32-based products. ESP-Jumpstart provides the optimal solution to getting started with product development. It is a comprehensive guide for developers, which helps them quickly achieve the conversion of their ideas into products. ESP-Jumpstart is based on [Espressif’s IoT Development Framework, ESP-IDF,](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) and discusses all the necessary steps and best practices for product development in a simple, well-structured and user-friendly way.

On a similar note, our German-speaking friends and supporters will be pleased to know that the* *[*Franzis*](https://www.elektor.de/franzis-maker-kit-fur-esp32)

[*Maker Kit for ESP32*](https://www.elektor.de/franzis-maker-kit-fur-esp32) has just been released. This maker kit contains everything you need to get started with microcontroller technology using our flagship SoC, [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32/overview). An ESP32 development board along with all the necessary components are included in this kit, so you can start implementing your own applications right away!

Other topics you can read about in this month’s newsletter include:

- The launching of ESP Apple HomeKit ADK, with which makers can now prototype non-commercial smart-home accessories with the open-source ESP Apple HomeKit Accessory Development Kit (ADK).
- The release of ESP Module, a powerful all-in-one device for microcontroller-based projects, which has been made by the US American start-up, Edge Devices.
- ESP_8_BIT, a new gadget with which you can enjoy Atari 8-bit computers, NES and SMS game consoles on your TV, with only an ESP32 and a sense of nostalgia.
