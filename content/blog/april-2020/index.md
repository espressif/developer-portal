Hi everyone,

Espressif is known for its keen sense of corporate social responsibility. We have long supported low-power, green technologies, while we have also based our entire business model on the idea of democratizing technology with open-source software .

At present, we are deeply concerned about climate change, which has been the result of human actions in recent decades. Hoping to create more public awareness of this crisis, we are launching a wildlife protection program which draws on the environmental insight brought about by [The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™](https://www.iucn.org/zh-hans/node/24442). This is considered the most authoritative guide for evaluating biodiversity and the extinction risk of thousands of species.

From now on, some of Espressif’s new development boards will be named after endangered animals. Some revenue from these development boards will be donated to the IUCN. We hope that our contribution will help the IUCN people to protect a greater number of threatened species. So far we have launched:

- [ESP32-Vaquita-DSPG](https://github.com/espressif/esp-va-sdk/blob/master/docs/en/hw-reference/esp32/user-guide-esp32-vaquita-dspg.md), an Alexa built-in solution named after [Vaquita](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/vaquita), the world’s rarest marine mammal on the verge of extinction.
- [ESP32-S2-Saola-1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/hw-reference/esp32s2/user-guide-saola-1-v1.2.html), a general-purpose development board named after [Saola](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/saola), the so-called Asian unicorn, which is a critically endangered mammal.
- [ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-S2-mass-production), a new multimedia development board, named after [Kaluga](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/10268/3186676), which is a critically endangered sturgeon inhabiting the Amur River in the Russian Far East.

Other topics you can read about in this month’s newsletter include:

- ESP RainMaker, Espressif’s end-to-end platform which enables makers realize their IoT ideas faster, with Espressif’s ESP32-S2 SoC, and without the hassle of managing the infrastructure involved.
- ESP32-Korvo, Espressif’s new AI development board, which features a multi-microphone array that enables it to achieve high performance, spoken-command recognition and far-field voice wake-up.
- The release of Espressif’s ESP8266 NonOS SDK, v3.0.3, which contains the latest bug fixes and updates.
- M5Stack ATOM, the smallest ESP32-based development board on the market, which is mainly designed for portable embedded systems and IoT development projects.

## M5Stack ATOM: An ESP32-based Portable Development Toolkit

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*IKJCrCt7e7d2jMZ6.png)

The [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview)-based M5Stack ATOM is the smallest development board on the market, measuring only 24×24mm. Designed for portable embedded systems and IoT development projects, [M5Stack ATOM](https://m5stack.com/products/atom-matrix-esp32-development-kit) is truly cost-effective not just because of its small size, but also because it has no integrated battery.
