## Introduction

Department of Technical Cybernetics of Faculty of Management Science and Informatics mainly focuses embedded systems and IoT networks, with implementing innovative approaches in such systems. Most of applications are powered by batteries, and require low power consumption and reliable traffic. Therefore, new wireless protocol ESP-NOW has become interesting field for implementation in IoT systems. Our testing mainly focuses on reliability of data transmission in indoor smart applications.

## Smart applications

Generally smart application brings up interconnection of multiple sensors via wired or wireless connection. In basic concept, system consist of:
- measurement unit (microcontroller, microprocessor with sensors, etc.), 
- processing unit (high performance microcontroller, single-board computer, cloud system, etc.) 
- actuator unit (heating, cooling, watering, etc.). 

By the most common smart appliances could be mentioned smart lightning, smart plugs, siol moisture monitoring, machine status monitoring or search and rescue systems.

### Communication protocols 

Communication protocols could be divided to two classes:
- __Wired Protocols:__ Mostly used between microcontrolers, microprocessors and sensors. Most common are UART, IIC, SPI, and in industrial appliances CAN. 
- __Wireless Protocols:__ Commonly used between sensor nodes, or nodes and processing unit, cloud. Mostly used are Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth or Bluetooth Low Energty, Matter, Thread or ESP-NOW. For data transmission over longer distances are implemented LoRa or GSM technologies. 

## ESP-NOW vs. Wi-Fi

Both ESP-NOW and Wi-Fi are radio-frequency communication protocols.

## Concept of data transmission and evaluation

By the motivation of research has been evaluation of range and packet loss of data transmission over time and according to placement and environment. 

Our network concept consist of 8 sensor nodes based on ESP32 simulating sensor data, and central node - based on ESP32-S3 and ESP32-C6 combination. Block scheme is on following figure.

Architecture of network is shown on following figure.

    >}}
Sensor nodes 1-8 are sending packets to central node over ESP-NOW. This device is recieving packets, and through UART sending to transmitter, connected to network over Wi-Fi. Data are consenquently sent to Thingspeak.


### Methods

Evaluation of packets received for period of time, with stable frequency of sending. Relative reliability is calculated as ratio of received packets to expected number packets. Relative packet loss is calculated as ratio of non-received packets to expected number packets.

Data has been sent to CU with period 250ms = 4 packets per second. Number of received packets is calculated for 30 seconds = 120 packets are expected with 0% packet loss.

### Placement

8 sensor nodes has been developed and placed over department. Each node has been sending packets to central unit. Description of placement is described on following picture.

### Results
As an result, we can see following comparison of multiple nodes. On following picture is success rate shown of nodes 1-4 and 5-8.

{{< figure

    >}}

Best success rate is defined as the lowest packet loss. It has been achieved between central unit and nodes 1,2,4,6.

## Conclusion and recommendations

By our meaurements we assume taht 50% of nodes are reliable, and packet loss highly depends on structure of the building â€“ number and structure of the walls between devices, percentage of open space. Future research will include analysis of signal over multiple floors. Furthermore, we need find place with lowest packet loss and changing power of signal on nodes to reduce power consumption of nodes.

As a recommendation for new large smart indoor application based on ESP-NOW protocol, we suggest to divide building to segments with highest percentage of open space, and usage of multiple central units. Also, developers should implement sophisticated software control of packet delivery and solve the issue of non-delivery status.
