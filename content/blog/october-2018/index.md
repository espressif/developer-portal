Welcome to our October Newsletter

Hi everyone,

The beginning of autumn has been marked by a bunch of exciting Espressif-related news. First and foremost, we released the latest version of [ESP-IDF v3.1](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/tag/v3.1) with improvements on previous features regarding its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, as well as its Security Manager Protocol (SMP). At the same time, certain companies in Espressif’s ecosystem introduced new ESP-related features, services and products, including Olimex’s ESP32 DevKit LiPo; Atmosphere’s platform update with [Wi-Fi support for ESP32](https://atmosphereiot.com/); the [Sensything ESP32 board](https://www.cnx-software.com/2018/09/26/sensything-esp32-board-multi-sensor-data-acquisition-wi-fi-bluetooth/) with multi-sensor data acquisition, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth; Zerynth’s [combination of IoT and Blockchain, using simple Python on the ESP32-DevKitC](https://www.hackster.io/lana-vulic/combining-iot-and-blockchain-using-simple-python-093746); and, last but not least, we also got a sneak peek of the upcoming [ESP32-powered watch](https://twitter.com/sqfmi/status/1042245367897751552) by [Squarofumi](https://www.sqfmi.com/) on Twitter!

Additionally, among the most recent independent [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview)-based projects that we distinguished were the [Pluto Quadcopter](https://twitter.com/anujdeshpandey/status/1032936504354471936) by the Indian startup [Drona Aviation](https://www.dronaaviation.com/); a [Code-Review Lamp](https://www.hackster.io/platisd/code-review-lamp-d52e87), notifying developer teams of pending code reviews (this one is for the fellow programmers out there!); the [Amazon Echo (IR) TV Remote](https://www.hackster.io/LIMPINGLIM/amazon-echo-ir-tv-remote-bf2c36); a [Bitcoin-activated power outlet](https://www.hackster.io/cswiger2/bitcoin-activated-power-outlet-ffc679); and an [IoT Pool Monitor](https://www.hackster.io/justind000/iot-pool-monitoring-with-thingsboard-4b0826),

measuring the pH, Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) and temperature of the water. The global community of developers never ceases to impress us with their new and inventive uses of Espressif products!

Other news you can find in the October edition of our newsletter include the two-day courses on building end-products with ESP-IDF, which we are jointly hosting with Grid Connect in Chicago and San Francisco this month; the release of Espressif’s Alexa SDK, which provides an implementation of Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service for the ESP32 microcontroller; an interview with the best-selling writer and maker, Erik Bartmann, about his latest book on ESP32, *Das ESP32 Praxisbuch *(The ESP32 Practice Book); and an ESP32-powered badge, Ph0xx, which can be easily turned into a bipedal mini robot!

Have you been to a hackathon or a high-tech event lately? Did they give you a digital badge that was interactive, hackable and reusable? Pretty cool, huh? Well, did you actually do something with your badge after the event, or did you put it in a dark desk drawer? If the latter is the case, the ESP32 Badge which can be turned into a bipedal robot might give you some inspiration as to what to do with your own badge.
