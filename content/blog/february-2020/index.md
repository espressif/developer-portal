Hi everyone,

We expect that all of you will have heard by now the news about the novel coronavirus epidemic in China and beyond. These are tough times indeed, but luckily, at the time of the outbreak, Espressif had already structured its IT system in such a way that has enabled the vast majority of staff members to work from home. As Espressif’s Founder and CEO, Teo Swee Ann, [mentioned in a recent message he posted on our website](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_CEO_Letter_2020): “__the disruption to our operations will be minimal. Our teams in Europe, India and China continue our work to best serve our customers.__ ”

Indeed, everyone at Espressif remains committed to working hard not just to overcome the current crisis, but also to honour our partnerships in China and abroad, and accomplish our goals for the first quarter of 2020, as well as for the rest of the year.

On this note, Teo Swee Ann, also mentioned in his recent message: “__In 2020, we will be launching four new chips, covering different segments of the market, price points and performance.__  Our latest chips feature our new radio architecture that has lower power consumption, while maintaining the same -40°C to +125°C performance. The peripherals have been upgraded with highly sensitive capacitive touch IOs. Capacitive touch controls are now a staple of user interfaces, because they are cost efficient; certain functions such as slider controls are better supported with capacitive touch than with analog implementations.”

Teo Swee Ann also pointed out: “__As you can see, we are not just about creating the best Wi-Fi chips, but also about providing our customers with complete and fully customizable solutions that work right out of the box.__  We also understand that connected product development and maintenance needs to be simplified, without compromising its flexibility. Try our latest [ESP32-S2](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s2_datasheet_en.pdf)-based ESP-RAINMAKER development boards that enable you to build the a complete cloud-connected product within a couple of hours.”

You can read Teo Swee Ann’s entire message [here](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_CEO_Letter_2020). Other topics you can read about in this month’s newsletter include:

- Espressif’s ESP32 SoC providing a qualified platform for Amazon Common Software for devices;
- ESP32-S2 SoCs, modules and development boards going into mass production from February 2020 onwards;
- Espressif’s partnership with Gigabits, a real-world IoT Sandbox for enterprises, developers, and makers looking to explore various IoT use cases and application spaces.
