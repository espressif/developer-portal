Espressif Systems (SSE: 688018.SH) announced ESP32-C5, the industryâ€™s first RISC-V SoC that supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz dual-band Wi-Fi 6, along with Bluetooth 5 (LE) and IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee, Thread) connectivity. Today, we are glad to announce that ESP32-C5  is now in mass production.

ESP32-C5 is designed for applications that require high-efficiency, low-latency wireless transmission. ESP32-C5 has a 32-bit single-core processor which can clock up to 240 MHz in speed. It has a 384 KB on-chip SRAM along with external PSRAM support, 320 KB of ROM. It has up to 29 programmable GPIOs, supporting all the commonly used peripherals, high speed interfaces like SDIO, QSPI, and the best-in-class security features. The ESP32-C5 also includes an LP-CPU running upto 40MHz which can act as the main processor for power sensitive applications.
