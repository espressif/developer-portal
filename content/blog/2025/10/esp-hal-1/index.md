In February this year, we announced the first [esp-hal 1.0 beta] release. Since then we've been hard at work, polishing and preparing for the full release. Today, the Rust team at Espressif is excited to announce the official `1.0.0` release for `esp-hal`, the _first_ vendor-backed Rust SDK!

### What We're Stabilizing Today

esp-hal is far from complete. We've spent many years researching and experimenting to get to this stage. However, to get a stable foundation to build from, the experimentation eventually needs to make way for stability. To achieve this, we've decided to limit the scope of 1.0 stabilization to:

- Initializing the hal, `esp_hal::init` and the relevant configuration associated with that.
- Four "core" drivers to start:
  - GPIO
  - UART
  - SPI
  - I2C
- The `time` module, which provides `Instant`, `Duration`, and `Rate`.
- A couple of miscellaneous system APIs (SoC reset, etc.).
- `#[main]` macro.
- Additional configuration parameters beyond feature flags.

With the exception of the list above, everything else in esp-hal is now feature gated behind the `unstable` feature. With the scope limited, post 1.0 we can incrementally stabilize drivers, much like the Rust project itself does, building on 1.0's foundation. 

### What About the Other `no_std` `esp-*` Crates?

esp-hal is the foundation of many of the esp-rs ecosystem crates, [esp-radio] (previously known as esp-wifi) is our next stabilization target, and builds directly on top of esp-hal. The end goal is of course to have every `esp-*` crate with a 1.0+ release eventually.

### Getting Started

The first step is to read our specially curated [book], which explains the ecosystem, tooling and some key embedded concepts for esp-hal.

As part of getting to 1.0, we've created our own project generation tool, [esp-generate] to bootstrap starting a project. This is explained fully in the [book], getting something building today should be as simple as:

```bash
cargo install esp-generate
```

then run

```bash
esp-generate
```

to launch the interactive project generation terminal user interface.

### Whatâ€™s Next?

If you're a company using (or considering) Rust on our chips, please do contact rust.support@espressif.com, we'd love to hear from you!
