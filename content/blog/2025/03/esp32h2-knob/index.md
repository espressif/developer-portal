## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced tech world, users are moving beyond simply wanting a variety of new smart platforms. Instead, they’re looking for an intelligent ecosystem where devices work together seamlessly, supported by tools that make managing them easier. This requires not only interoperability between devices but also the ability for them to understand and respond to users’ diverse needs, offering more personalized and intelligent services. As a result, ensuring communication across different brands and platforms has become an increasingly important challenge in the smart technology space.

To address this challenge, the ESP32-H2_Knob comes into play. Designed to connect seamlessly with a wide range of devices from different brands, it supports multiple communication protocols, enabling interoperability across various platforms. With the ESP32-H2_Knob, users can enjoy a truly connected ecosystem where different smart devices work together effortlessly. Using only one ESP-Knob, you can instantly switch between devices and adjust their settings.

## Overview of ESP-Knob

The ESP-Knob is a multifunctional smart knob controller developed by Espressif Application team and powered by the [ESP32-H2](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-h2) chip. It not only integrates with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) but also widely supports wireless communication protocols such as [BLE-HID](https://novelbits.io/bluetooth-hid-devices-an-intro/), [Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/What-is-Thread/Overview), [Matter](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-matter/en/latest/esp32h2/introduction.html#introduction), [ESP-BLE-MESH](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.2.3/esp32h2/api-guides/esp-ble-mesh/ble-mesh-index.html#esp-ble-mesh), and [Zigbee](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-zigbee-sdk/en/latest/esp32h2/index.html#esp-zigbee-sdk-programming-guide). By establishing connections with mainstream smart devices like Apple [HomePod](https://www.apple.com/homepod/) and [Amazon Echo](https://www.dxomark.cn/amazon-echo-4th-gen-speaker-review-wider-than-meets-the-eye/), the ESP32-H2_Knob helps bridge cross-platform gaps, enabling simpler collaboration between devices from different ecosystems

The front of the ESP-Knob features a push-rotary knob housed in a durable aluminum alloy casing, capable of detecting both pressing and rotating actions. The back is equipped with a strong magnetic base that securely attaches to metal surfaces, offering flexible and convenient control placement.

## Hardware Design

The hardware design of the ESP-Knob is relatively simple. Apart from the basic battery power supply circuit, rotary knob circuit, and download/debugging circuit, it only includes a simple LED indicator circuit. The hardware system of the ESP-Knob is composed as follows:

{{< figure
default=true

height=500
caption="ESP-Knob Hardware Design"
    >}}

The circuit blocks annotated in the drawing are as follows:

- **`Main MCU`**: [ESP32-H2-MINI-1-H2](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-h2-mini-1_mini-1u_datasheet_en.pdf) module

- **`EC11 (Rotary Encoder):`** Used for user input, capable of detecting both rotation and press operations. The press signal from the EC11 controls `VCC_EN`, which is used for power switching or mode switching.  

- **`5V → 3.3V (Power Module):`** Uses the XC6206P332MR-G low-dropout linear regulator to step down the USB power supply (5V) to the 3.3V required by the [ESP32-H2](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-h2_datasheet_en.pdf).  

- **`VBAT → 3.3V (Power Module):`** Utilizes the TPS61291 boost converter to accommodate a wide input voltage range, supplying 3.3V to the [ESP32-H2](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-h2_datasheet_en.pdf) during operation. When the [ESP32-H2](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-h2_datasheet_en.pdf) is in sleep mode, it is directly powered by the battery, and supporting low-power on sleep mode for wake-up functionality.  

- **`USB-C Interface:`** Use a USB-C port connect to the ESP32-H2 and used for data transmission and power supply.  

- **`LED (LED Module):`** Uses `GPIO2` and `GPIO3` of the [ESP32-H2](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-h2_datasheet_en.pdf) to control a dual-color LED for lighting and off, and used indicating different operating states of the ESP-Knob.  

- **`BATTERY (Battery Management Module):`** Connects an external lithium battery (VBAT) through BT1 and monitors the battery voltage. The voltage is divided to BAT_ADC, allowing the ESP32-H2 to monitor the battery level.  

- **`DEBUG (Download & Debug Interface):`** A reserved test point for the download interface and hardware reset interface of the ESP-Knob device. By connecting to the ESP32-H2’s UART0 interface `(TXD0 and RXD0`), it supports firmware flashing and debugging. Pulling the `ESP_EN` pin low allows for a hardware reset of the ESP-Knob.
