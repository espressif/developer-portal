We all love [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) as a powerful AI-powered coding assistant that enhances productivity. However, until now, it has been officially available only for VS Code and a few other editors. But here’s some good news for Eclipse users! We have tried the [Copilot4Eclipse](https://www.genuitec.com/products/copilot4eclipse/) plugin with the [Espressif-IDE C/C++ Editor](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-ide/en/latest/additionalfeatures/lspeditor.html#lsp-c-c-editor), and it works amazingly well, helping to write code faster and fix bugs.

## Introducing Copilot4Eclipse

If you've been waiting for GitHub Copilot support in Eclipse, look no further than [Copilot4Eclipse](https://www.genuitec.com/products/copilot4eclipse/) — a fantastic plugin that brings Copilot's AI-assisted code generation to the Eclipse IDE. While the experience may not be identical to VS Code, Copilot4Eclipse offers similar features, making AI-assisted development possible within Eclipse.

## How Copilot4Eclipse Enhances Development

### AI-Powered Code Suggestions

Copilot4Eclipse generates entire functions, suggests code completions, and refactors snippets, streamlining development and boosting efficiency. It assists with boilerplate code, ESP32 API calls, and even offers intelligent improvements to your implementation—helping you write better code, faster.
