With highly integrated MCU embedded Wi-Fi solutions, such as the popular ESP32 and ESP8266, Espressif achieved sales of one hundred million IoT chipsets by the end of 2017. This new round of investment is another milestone in Espressif’s development and will strengthen the company’s R&D capabilities and help increase its market influence.
