## Announcement

Back in September 2021, Arduino ESP32 Core version 2.0.0 was announced and introduced the support for the ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3 (in a later release) and ESP32-C3. This release was a huge milestone for the community not only because of the new SoCs (System on Chips) support but also because of the new era for the project, including an enormous number of new features, bug fixes, new examples, drivers, and the core documentation in 14 releases, 800 commits have been added by 88 contributors after the 2.0.0 release.

Since the Arduino ESP32 core version 2.0.0, new chips became available, and new features are now needed to keep and improve the developer’s experience and the integration with Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment). To continue with the remarkable success of version 2.0.0, the Arduino ESP32 core team is working hard in cooperation with the community to not stop making history.

Now it is time to announce the Arduino ESP32 Core major version 3.0.0 release with new SoC’s support (now including support for ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2), API improvements and breaking changes.

## ESP32-C6

Announced in 2022, this new SoC from the C-series introduced the Wi-Fi 6 and the 802.15.4.
