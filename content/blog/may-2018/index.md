Hi everyone,

We said goodbye to April with a glorious party celebrating Espressif’s 10th birthday! Espressif was created on April 29th, 2008. Back then our company was a small Chinese startup fueled with the vision of its CEO and founder, Teo Swee Ann. It soon became apparent that Espressif’s field of specialization would be the Internet of Things. Our company evolved significantly in this area, leaving its indelible mark with such popular IoT solutions as [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview)and [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview). During the last decade, Espressif has changed from being a Chinese technology startup to being a multinational company providing fast, secure and green IoT solutions that can be available to all.

To celebrate our tenth anniversary we launched Espressif’s brand new Instagram account, which you can follow by clicking [here](https://www.instagram.com/espressif_systems/). They say that a picture is worth a thousand words. Since Instagram is based on broadcasting pictures mainly, we want to use the power of image in order to communicate our brand, our values and our technologies to the worldwide community of IoT developers. We really hope that you join us in this new journey through social media, which is meant to complement our presence on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EspressifSystem), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/espressif/) and [WeChat](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zcuHVGHS78U8NawUI6rF9Q).

One day prior to Espressif’s birthday, our Indian branch in Pune hosted an [IoT meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Internet-Of-Things-Pune-IoTPune/events/249858635/). These meetups are monthly events scheduled for the

last Saturday of every month. Every session includes one or two technical presentations, followed by demonstrations of exciting projects from the IoT community in Pune. The last meetup on April 28th, examined how MQTT started and evolved as a dominant protocol for TCP/IP communications. The specific topics included an explanation of MQTT 3.1, the new aspects of MQTT 5, and a presentation of AWS IoT as an MQTT broker. The session was very successful attracting numerous attendees who left their positive remarks on the [event’s webpage](https://www.meetup.com/Internet-Of-Things-Pune-IoTPune/events/249858635/). In the May edition of our newsletter you will also find out more about the results of the ESP32 Design Contest 2018, which we organized and delivered together with Elektor International Media; the release of the much anticipated ESP-IDF v3.0; Espressif’s official mesh development framework, ESP-MDF, which supports mesh applications for the ESP32 chip in the most comprehensive way; and “Atmosphere IoT”, the innovative cloud platform which has just started providing support for our ESP32 chipsets.

We hope that you enjoy reading the May edition of our newsletter and that you continue following us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/espressif_systems/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/espressif/) , [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EspressifSystem) and [WeChat](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zcuHVGHS78U8NawUI6rF9Q).

Best wishes, John Lee

Remember last January when we [announced](https://www.espressif.com/en/media_overview/news/esp32-design-contest-2018?position=17&list=aFQ9TMtvmF3RxsudZcBkwp5VY6JFM7D9Pt40VeOeWag) that we would organize a contest about ESP32 Design together with [Elektor International Media](https://www.elektor.com/)? After receiving a great number of remarkable entries, our judging panel, which consisted of engineers from Espressif and Elektor, announced the winners at the end of last month. Our judges noted that the programming level of all participating entries was considerably high, which made their task more challenging, but also more intellectually stimulating and exciting.
