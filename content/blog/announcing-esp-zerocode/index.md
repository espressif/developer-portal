Today Espressif is launching the ESP ZeroCode. This is a web application that lets you quickly prepare Matter-certifiable firmware, as per your requirements, in just a few clicks. You describe the kind of product you wish to create, the features you want to have, and its hardware configuration, that’s it. You can instantly try out the generated firmware on the physical hardware. If you don’t like something, you go back and tweak it all you want. This is truly a magical experience, try creating a product now at the [ESP ZeroCode Console](https://zerocode.espressif.com/).

Once you are satisfied, you can directly place orders, and get the ESP ZeroCode modules delivered to you. The ESP ZeroCode modules are pre-flashed with the firmware and all the contents required to make this a fully functional Matter device. All the complexities of unique manufacturing and programming are already taken care of.

With ESP ZeroCode, you skip the development, as well as the maintenance phase of a typical product cycle. You directly manufacture and launch your products in the market. Espressif continues to maintain the firmware with the latest updates and security fixes to ensure that your in-field devices are always secure and Matter compatible.

## Exceptional End-User Experience

All ESP ZeroCode modules are Matter certified, they work out of the box with any other Matter ecosystem of your choice. For all these platforms your users do not need a separate phone app to talk to these devices. The devices can be configured and controlled directly through leading ecosystem vendor apps or through the respective voice assistants; guaranteeing the best experience your users can have with your products.

## Cost-optimized

Matter standard compatibility results in reduced direct and indirect product costs.

For direct cost savings— Matter compatible devices don’t necessarily need to have an always-on cloud connectivity. They can be controlled remotely using the ecosystem hubs (such as Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod, Apple TV, or Google Nest hubs). The voice control too doesn’t require cloud-to-cloud messaging as voice assistants control the devices using Matter protocol in the local network.

In terms of indirect cost savings — You don’t have to develop and maintain phone apps or voice assistant skills. Activities like Matter-compatible firmware development, maintenance, certification, and device manufacturing, which otherwise can add to the cost, is handled by Espressif in this ZeroCode offering.

## Simplified Manufacturing

When you order ESP ZeroCode modules, the hardware modules are pre-flashed with all the specific details necessary for your product and its configuration. The per-device unique configurations like Device Attestation Certificates, QR codes, device identifiers, and other details, which usually take longer on the factory line, are also pre-programmed.

Specifically, Device Attestation Certificates provisioning requires setting up engagement with some signing service and a secure manufacturing setup which otherwise can add to the cost and time significantly. With ZeroCode modules you get this out of the box.

This means all you have to do is mount these modules on your PCBs, apply the corresponding QR code stickers, and you are good to go. Everything else is already taken care of.

## Product Branding

The ESP ZeroCode modules are so certified that you may use the *Matter* badge on your product packaging (actual logos may vary). This logo helps the consumers choose products which they can be assured of having Matter compliance and hence greater interoperability.

The ESP ZeroCode modules are, optionally, certified to work well with ecosystem vendors as well. This allows for more seamless integration with these ecosystems. If opted, additional badges of __Works with Apple Home,__ and __Works With Google Home,__ may be used on your product packaging subject to your product meeting the guidelines as highlighted in the respective programs

## Secure, Robust and Well-maintained

The ESP ZeroCode modules, by default, have the highest possible security settings, like secure boot and flash encryption, configured on them.

Additionally, the firmware is closely aligned with Matter’s open-source repository. Espressif ensures that the ESP ZeroCode modules will continue to get over-the-air (OTA) firmware upgrades for the next 3 years so that the latest security fixes are deployed on these devices as early as possible.

## Supported Device Types

Today, the ESP ZeroCode portal supports a wide variety of devices including light bulbs, panels, downlights, lamps, LED strips, switches, wall sockets, and blind controllers among others. For all these devices, you may choose either Wi-Fi or 802.15.4/Thread-based connectivity.

We are currently working on supporting more configurable device features as well as device types. If you are looking for a specific device type, please reach out to [zerocode@espressif.com](mailto:zerocode@espressif.com) with your request.

## Get Going

If you find this exciting, head over to the [ESP ZeroCode console](https://zerocode.espressif.com) and start creating your product. With the *Try in ESP Launchpad *feature you can instantly try the configured product, and once satisfied place volume orders.

We are excited about the launch of ESP ZeroCode and look forward to enabling great end-user experiences!
