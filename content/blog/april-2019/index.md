Welcome to our April Newsletter

Hi everyone,

We’re really excited this month because Espressif has just started the process of offering its shares to the public for the first time (IPO), through the Shanghai Stock Exchange. We are hopeful that this process will come to fruition by the end of the year and that Espressif will be listed on the new Science and Technology Innovation Board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The Science and Technology Innovation Board, which aspires to become the Chinese version of Nasdaq, is designed to help technology-oriented enterprises grow their finances and drive innovation.

Espressif has gone from strength to strength over the last few years. Our achievements include prestigious collaborations, awards and investments, while also providing evidence that our business cycle has significantly expanded both in China and abroad. Submitting, then, our IPO application to the Shanghai Stock Exchange was the next step in our path to driving technological innovation in China and beyond.

Other news you can read in this month’s newsletter include:

- Jumpstart, Espressif’s new reference guide which aims to
- help developers convert their ideas into actual products in the least possible amount of time;
- Embedding voice into ESP32 devices using Google’s Dialogflow, which provides developers with a hassle-free way of building their own conversational platforms for their own products;
- ESP-EYE being featured on WeChat, which is China’s biggest social media platform, with more than a billion monthly active users; and last, but not least,
- “Kevin”, who is your new ESP32-based virtual housemate. Built by Mitipi, a Swiss startup, Kevin seems “determined” to deter any burglars from breaking into your house.

Hope you enjoy reading this month’s newsletter. Keep sending us your messages and requests on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and YouTube. We respond to all of your messages as quickly as possible!

Best wishes, John Lee. Senior Customer Support Officer

To people living outside China, [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/)’s ubiquitous messaging application,[ WeChat](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/04/what-is-wechat-china-biggest-messaging-app.html), might be relatively unknown.
