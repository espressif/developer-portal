Hi everyone, The month of April is an exciting one for Espressif, since it is our birthday month. This year, in particular, we are celebrating the tenth birthday of our company on 29 April, and we plan our celebrations to extend even in May! Many things have coincided with this occasion, making our tenth anniversary even more special.

Our brand new audio development boards, [ESP32-LyraTD-MSC](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-lyratd-msc_user_guide_en.pdf) and [ESP32-LyraT](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-adf/en/latest/design-guide/dev-boards/), have been officially released and our customers can order them or make enquiries about them through our [CRM system](https://www.espressif.com/en/company/contact/pre-sale-questions-crm). Also, [ESP32-WROOM-32D](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32d_esp32-wroom-32u_datasheet_en.pdf) is now available to the Japanese market through [www.switch-science.com](https://www.switch-science.com/catalog/3753/). ESP32-WROOM-32D is a powerful Wi-Fi+BT/BLE module that targets a wide variety of applications, ranging from low-power sensor networks to the most demanding tasks, such as voice encoding, music streaming and MP3 decoding.

Additionally, our presence in Europe is becoming stronger by the day. Our branch in the Czech Republic is developing quickly, while also our distribution partners in France, Astone Technology, brought Espressif to the spotlight in the latest exhibition in Paris about [embedded systems and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications](https://www.zyyne.com/) at the Expo Porte de Versailles on 21 and 22 March 2018.

Most importantly, however, the latest report by [Techno Systems Research](http://www.t-s-r.co.jp/) regarding the 2017 market shares in the semiconductorindustry was released last month, showing that Espressif Systems ranked first in the MCU Embedded Wi-Fi market with a share of about 30%, which was well over that of our competitors. As our company continues to develop, it is important to us to be not only a mainstream IoT company, but an integral part of the innovation that drives the semiconductor industry forward. We will continue creating IoT solutions that deliver exactly this. Furthermore, we will remain loyal to our motto about the democratization of technology, maintaining our competitive prices which allow everyone’s access to the alluring world of IoT.

In the April edition of our newsletter you will also find out more about Talent Land 2018, the biggest gathering of hi-tech people in Latin America, and the ESP8266-powered electronic badge that they offer as a limited-edition souvenir; a very interesting tutorial about how to use ESP8266 and/or ESP32 to achieve voice-controlled relay; a home-made Arduino robot based on ESP8266, which everyone can recreate in order to control their home appliances over the internet; and an ESP8266-enabled smart-parking app to assist you in finding and reserving an available parking spot, so that others cannot beat you to it.

On 2 April Talent Land 2018 started. This is the largest innovation and entrepreneurship event that takes place in Mexico every year. It is a five-day event addressed to the maker community in Latin America, attracting talented young developers, investors, institutions and recruiters who meet up, share knowledge and strengthen the community’s development. What’s more, this year there is a limited-edition badge designed specifically for Talent Land 2018, which is based on our very own [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview).

## Voice-Controlled Relay with ESP32 and ESP8266

Rui Santos has just published on his very interesting RNT blog a [tutorial](https://www.randomnerdtutorials.com/alexa-echo-with-esp32-and-esp8266/)through which readers can learn how to control [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview) or [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) with voice commands, using Amazon’s Alexa. The RNT blog helps makers, hobbyists and engineers build projects about electronics. In this particular tutorial, Rui uses the example of controlling two 12V lamps, with a relay. He also shows how to physically control these lamps, using a wireless 433 MHz switch on a wall.

## ESP8266-based GO-4 Smart-Home Arduino Bot

Ahmed Azouz, an Egyptian software engineer, has developed an application that uses the ESP8266 IoT technology to control home appliances remotely over the internet. Ahmed said on hackster.io, where his project is published in full: “There is a small technological marvel called [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview) and it is a great tool for enabling your project’s access to the internet. You can plug it into an Arduino easily and control it over the internet from anywhere in the world via its unique IP address!”

## ESP8266-Controlled Smart-Parking

“[Astro](https://www.hackster.io/90426/smart-park-with-astro-6fe898?utm_campaign=new_projects&utm_content=1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=hackster&utm_term=project_name)” is a smart-parking system created by [Priyanka Joshi](https://www.hackster.io/priyanka-joshi), a graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas majoring in Computer Science with specialization in Intelligent Systems, and Shubham Pradeep Kothari. Astro was created to save drivers’ time and fuel wastage, while looking for parking space, which can be quite an arduous task in densely populated urban areas. Of course, the whole project has been based on our powerful [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview).
