Hi everyone,

As many of you may have already heard, Shanghai is currently undergoing a major lockdown due to COVID-19. In the midst of this lockdown, we received our production wafers of ESP32-C2, and proceeded with verification. Quarantine rules have caused us some logistics problems, but gradually we managed to find solutions and go ahead with ramping up the design and production of this chip. Also, thanks to Espressifers from Brazil, the Czech Republic, India and Singapore, the integration of ESP32-C2 into ESP-IDF and ESP-RainMaker continues at full speed.

__ESP32-C2 is a combo Wi-Fi 4 + Bluetooth 5 ( LE) chip__  that was conceived during last year’s semiconductor supply shortages which -to a certain extent- persist even today. Hence, one of the most important goals for us in creating this chip was to reduce its silicon area and the flash size requirement. Thus, after almost a year of preparations, the resulting chip targets simple, high-volume, low-data-rate, IoT applications, such as smart plugs and light bulbs.

ESP32-C2 is a chip __in a 4mm x 4mm package__ , with __272 kB of memory__ . It runs frameworks, such as [__ESP-Jumpstart__ ](https://github.com/espressif/esp-jumpstart/blob/master/README.md) and [__ESP RainMaker®__ ](https://rainmaker.espressif.com/), while it also runs [__ESP-IDF__ ](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf). ESP-IDF is Espressif’s open-source, real-time operating system for embedded IoT devices, which has been trusted by users across the whole wide world. It is supported by [Espressif](http://www.espressif.com/) and the community for all [ESP32 chips](https://www.esp32.com/). __The ROM code of ESP32-C2 is optimized, as it reduces the need for flash.__ 

__Thus, if you need a small, simple and cheap SoC that is able to provide your application with robust connectivity, ESP32-C2 is the way to go.Besides, ESP32-C2 also continues the tradition of Espressif’s excellent security, having such features as secure boot and flash encryption, while also providing hardware root-of-trust for any applications.__

[__Introducing the ESP USB Bridge__ ](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-C2)

The [ESP USB Bridge](https://github.com/espressif/esp-usb-bridge) is an ESP-IDF project utilizing [ESP32-S2](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s2) or [ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3) to create a link between a computer and a target microcontroller. It can serve as a replacement for USB-to-UART chips, e.g. CP210x.
