Hi everyone,

*electronica 2022*, the world’s leading trade fair and conference for electronics, is taking place in Munich, from 15 to 18 November 2022 and, of course, Espressif Systems will be there!

Anticipation in the industry is high, since the last in-person trade fair took place four years ago, due to the global pandemic. [*electronica*](https://electronica.de/en/visitors/tickets-prices/) is the world’s most important industry gathering (and the only one this year) which will seamlessly cover the entire spectrum of electronics by bringing together key players, decision makers and visionaries from the global electronics community. More than 2,000 exhibitors covering a wide range of topics have already registered to present their latest technologies and solutions at this year’s trade fair.

In terms of content, not only will *electronica* cover a huge range of topics through the offerings of its exhibitors, but it will also feature an extensive supporting program in which industry experts will impart their wealth of specialist knowledge. As is tradition, the trade fair will be complemented by the electronica Conferences, which this year will deal with the topics of Automotive, Embedded Platforms, and Wireless Systems and Applications. The *electronica* Forums will focus, in particular, on applications and solutions, providing a valuable source of inspiration for visitors, thanks to the practical presentations and panel discussions in those Forums.

In 2022, the trade fair will be held under the motto ‘Driving sustainable progress,’ as the electronics industry plays a vital role in paving the way for future social issues and for the transition to a high-tech society. The CEOs of leading semiconductor companies will also discuss the industry’s contribution to protecting the climate at the CEO Roundtable. Additional topics of global relevance running through the trade fair include electric mobility, cybersecurity, embedded systems, industrial IoT, sustainability, smart energy, connectivity, AI, sensors and measurement technology. All in all, *electronica* offers a platform that will bring together experts and users demonstrating practice-oriented and sustainable solutions to combating the challenges of our time.
