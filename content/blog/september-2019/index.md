Hi everyone,

The ESP32-Azure IoT Kit has been granted a Microsoft certification which makes it integral to Microsoft’s Plug-and-Play program. This has been designed to bring the ease of “Plug and Play” to IoT devices. So, developers can plug virtually any peripheral into a Windows PC without having to worry about drivers. As a result, not only has Espressif been featured as an official partner of Microsoft’s IoT Plug and Play program, but also the ESP32-Azure IoT Kit is now featured on the product list of Microsoft’s Azure IoT solutions.

Another exciting piece of news that came in this month was that Norvi, a Sri Lankan IoT company, rolled out its industrial IoT controller (IIOT), which is based on Espressif Systems’ microcontrollers. To provide a value-adding device to a growing market, Norvi designed the Espressif-based IIOT, which ensures high-quality connectivity for industrial IoT applications. Moreover, it comes with the option of either an ESP32-WROOM-32 module or an ESP8266 microcontroller.

Norvi’s IIOT offers a dual-core 32-bit CPU that achieves a total of 160 MHz. Moreover, this is combined with a 520KB SRAM and a 4MB Flash. Using such a powerful processor ensures that IIOT also conforms to stringent industrial standards.

Other news you can read in this month’s newsletter include:

- Obniz, an all-inclusive IoT platform for ESP32, created by the Japanese company Cambrian Robotics Inc. The obniz solution comprises a dev board, an operating system and cloud services.
- Measuring particulate pollution with ESP32, which may offer a much-needed solution to a growing number of cities across the globe, where CO2 emissions are, sadly, still on the increase.
- IoT-based heart monitoring (ECG) with an AD8232 ECG Sensor and ESP32. This is a solution that may prove valuable to thousands of people facing heart problems.

## Obniz: A New ESP32-based Dev Board, OS and Cloud

Obniz is an ESP32-based development board for IoT applications, functioning over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (Classic and BLE). The obniz dev board can be connected to the obniz cloud, while it can be controlled in various programming languages and environments. The unique hardware of the obniz dev board is based on the powerful ESP32-WROOM-32, Espressif’s Wi-Fi+BT/BLE module that targets a wide variety of applications.

## ESP32-based Measurement of Particulate Pollution

A network engineer from Israel, Nir Huri, has created a project that measures particulate pollution — a cause of concern for many people in the present-day climate crisis. Nir Huri’s gadget measures particulate matter with an SDS011 sensor, while ESP32 functions as the brain of the operation, due to its onboard net-working capabilities.

## IoT-based Heart Monitoring with ESP32

A useful tutorial which is on the cusp between technology and healthcare has been recently posted by Alex Newton on how2electronics.com. This post is about IoT-based electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring with an AD8232 ECG Sensor and ESP32, using the online IoT platform Ubidots. It is important to highlight that the ECG signal from a patient’s heart can be checked online from any part of the world.
