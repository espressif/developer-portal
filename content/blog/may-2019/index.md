Hi everyone,

The beginning of May found us celebrating not only this year’s Labor Day Festival, which was a four-day public holiday in China, but also the new phase of Espressif’s collaborations with Google and Microsoft. Our popular [ESP32-DevKitC](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-devkitc/overview) now enables an easy evaluation and development for [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview)-based products connected to the [Google Cloud IoT Core](https://cloud.google.com/iot-core/). Similarly, our [ESP32-Azure IoT Kit](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-azure-kit) is dedicated to supporting [Microsoft’s Azure IoT cloud services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/). We have recently added “Joint Development” to our dropdown menu under the “Products” tab on the landing page of our website, in order to offer our customers a detailed presentation of the two development kits mentioned above. You can also find a short description below.

[ESP32-DevKitC-GoogleCloud-IoT](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-devkitc-googlecloud-iot/overview#) is built around [ESP32-WROOM-32D](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32d_esp32-wroom-32u_datasheet_en.pdf)and provides out-of-the-box Google Cloud IoT connectivity. This unbeatable dev kit enables rapid prototyping by being breadboard-friendly and feature-rich. We’re equally proud of our [ESP32-Azure IoT Kit](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-azure-kit), which is a development kit designed with powerful functions, such as sensor data acquisition and cloud platform access, as well as a wide range of applications.

Other news you can read in this month’s newsletter include:

- ESP-IDF v3.2, the latest version of Espressif’s IoT Development framework, which has just been released;
- The ekey UNO finger scanner, an innovative security system, which has been based on Espressif’s ESP32-WROVER module and made in Austria;
- LyraT-Mini, a new development board that is small in size, yet highly versatile and powerful, which will soon be added to Espressif’s Lyra series; and last, but not least,
- *The Complete ESP32 Projects Guide*, Prof. Dragan Ibrahim’s new book about ESP32, which has just been published by Elektor.
