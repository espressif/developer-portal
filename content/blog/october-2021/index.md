Hi everyone,

Last week __Amazon announced__ [__Alexa Connect Kit SDK (ACK SDK)__ ](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2021/10/new-alexa-connect-kit-sdk-for-smart-home-devices), a software package that enables Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) and System Integrators (SIs) to build their own ACK-based modules and differentiated, Alexa-compatible, smart-device solutions without having to worry about managing cloud services, building an app, or writing an Alexa skill.

ODMs and SI solution providers, such as Leedarson, Tonly, Innotech, and Linkplay, __are already developing solutions with ACK SDK on Espressif hardware__ . With the new ACK SDK, developers can build their own Alexa-compatible solutions with the same benefits as ACK, and with more control over costs and features.

On this occasion, __Espressif’s Director of Technical Marketing, Mr. Amey Inamdar said:__  “We are pleased to be part of the ACK SDK program, and excited to partner with Amazon to announce our first ACK SDK-compatible development kit. Espressif’s ACK SDK-compatible development kit is going to make it even easier for solution providers and device makers to use our products to build innovative, connected-devices using the best-in-class ACK SDK”.

[Here](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2021/10/new-alexa-connect-kit-sdk-for-smart-home-devices), you can read more about how the new ACK SDK works, and how you can start building with it today.
