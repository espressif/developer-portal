Hi everyone,

At the beginning of the month, Espressif’s Founder and CEO, Mr Teo Swee-Ann, gave an interview to the [Electronic Engineering Times (EETimes)](https://www.eetimes.com/nl-archive/EE-Times-Weekend-210501.html), a leading news and analysis magazine about the latest technologies and business developments in the global electronics industry. In this interview, readers had the opportunity to learn more about Teo Swee-Ann, who holds 40 patents in circuit design and AIoT technology, is an avid Go player, a classical guitarist, a husband, and a father of four wonderful children.

Teo Swee-Ann explained that he does not directly talk about technology with his children, but he does have conversations with them about the implications of today’s technological innovations. “I just want to make sure that they have some thoughts about these questions and their ethical consequences. […] technology should be developed and used in such a way that results in meaningful progress and a better outcome for the future generations”.

Talking about his leadership style, Teo Swee-Ann characterized it as “variable and pragmatic”. […] “As CEO, I focus on creating value for our customers and the long-term growth of the company… [But] we are an amalgamation of 500 engineers and staff from about 30 different countries connected via face-to-face interactions, emails, messaging apps, MatterMost, Git repositories, shared docs, Zoom meetings, and our core values. We have a rather flat organization […] making decisions and [developing] strategies collectively”.
