Hi everyone,

Our friends at [ThingPulse](https://thingpulse.com/about/), Daniel Eichhorn and Marcel Stör, are preparing a treat for the European fans of Espressif boards. They are holding three IoT workshops in beautiful Zürich, in November 2019 and January 2020, which will be about introducing the Internet of Things to children and adults in an interactive setup with many hands-on exercises on __Espressif boards__ . Anyone from 12 years up, including grandparents with kids, are welcome! Prior programming skills may prove to be helpful but are not required.

The ThingPulse IoT workshops will cover topics such as:

- [Wi-Fi Weather Station with ESP8266 and Arduino IDE](https://thingpulse.com/workshop-registration/?workshop=Classic+Weather+Station&date=2019-11-16)__(November 16th, 2019)__ This session is aimed at Arduino and ESP8266 beginners with affinity for technology and computer science.
- [Build and Program a Color Weather Station with ESP8266 and Arduino IDE](https://thingpulse.com/workshop-registration/?workshop=Color+Weather+Station&date=2019-11-30)__(November 30th, 2019)__ Participants will be shown how to solder and then program a weather station with a fancy color touch display.
- [“You’ve got Mail” — Advanced IoT with ESP32 and Platform IO](https://thingpulse.com/workshop-registration/?workshop=Advanded+IoT&date=2020-01-15)__(January 15th, 2020)__ Attendees will learn about ESP32 features and quirks, as well as how to build a mailbox-to-push-notification sensing device.

So, do you -or someone you know- want to learn more about IoT, but don’t know where to start from? Then, the ThingPulse IoT workshops are for you, because they are all about learning, sharing and a having a good time! All you need to do is register [here](https://thingpulse.com/iot-workshops/).
