Hi everyone,

Our friends at [ThingPulse](https://thingpulse.com/about/), Daniel Eichhorn and Marcel Stör, are preparing a treat for the European fans of Espressif boards. They are holding three IoT workshops in beautiful Zürich, in November 2019 and January 2020, which will be about introducing the Internet of Things to children and adults in an interactive setup with many hands-on exercises on __Espressif boards__ . Anyone from 12 years up, including grandparents with kids, are welcome! Prior programming skills may prove to be helpful but are not required.

The ThingPulse IoT workshops will cover topics such as:

- Wi-Fi Weather Station with ESP8266 and Arduino IDE __(November 16th, 2019)__ This session is aimed at Arduino and ESP8266 beginners with affinity for technology and computer science.
- Build and Program a Color Weather Station with ESP8266 and Arduino IDE __(November 30th, 2019)__ Participants will be shown how to solder and then program a weather station with a fancy color touch display.
- “You’ve got Mail” — Advanced IoT with ESP32 and Platform IO __(January 15th, 2020)__ Attendees will learn about ESP32 features and quirks, as well as how to build a mailbox-to-push-notification sensing device.

So, do you -or someone you know- want to learn more about IoT, but don’t know where to start from? Then, the ThingPulse IoT workshops are for you, because they are all about learning, sharing and a having a good time! Places are limited and filling up quickly. So, hurry up!

Other topics you can read in this month’s newsletter include:

- ESP-BLE-MESH, which is now fully certified by Bluetooth SIG;
- ESP32 being launched into space, which happened through a research project at the German Aerospace Center;
- ESP8266, which is now listed on the Tencent Cloud, supporting the quick connection of ESP8266 to IoT Explorer, Tencent’s Cloud IoT platform;
- ESP32-based smart devices winning innovation-of-the-year awards in India.
