Happy New Year to all!

Everyone here at Espressif would like to wish you health, happiness and creativity for 2020! As ever, we shall continue working hard in trying to give you the best in the field of AIoT. The outgoing year has been an incredible one for our company. In 2019 we released [ESP-WHO](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who), our AI development framework, along with its accompanying development board, [ESP-EYE](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp-eye/overview). We also launched the [ESP-Jumpstart](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-jumpstart/en/latest/introduction.html) framework to help developers convert their ideas into actual products as quickly as possible. And we also put [ESP-Skainet](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/software/esp-skainet/overview), Espressif’s voice assistant, on the market. At the same time, we consolidated our collaboration with the [Google Cloud IoT platform](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-devkitc-googlecloud-iot/overview), [Tencent Cloud IoT platform](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP8266_Listed_on_Tencent_Cloud) and [Microsoft Azure IoT solutions](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-azure-kit).

Furthermore, we made an [impressive debut](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_IPO) in a field of 25 companies that launched their initial public offering on the Sci-Tech Innovation Board (STAR) of Shanghai’s Stock Exchange in July 2019. Last, but not least, ESP-BLE-MESH, our implementation of the SIG Bluetooth Mesh got [fully certified by Bluetooth-SIG](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP_BLE_MESH_SIG_Certified) and at the same time other Espressif chips advanced their certification credentials, as shown below:

- [ESP-WROOM-02D](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp-wroom-02u_esp-wroom-02d_datasheet_en.pdf): ANATEL / IFETEL
- [ESP32-S2-WROVER](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/modules): SRRC / CE / FCC
- [ESP32-WROVER-B](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wrover-b_datasheet_en.pdf): Wi-Fi Alliance

These are only a few of our achievements in 2019, but they are the basis of why we look into 2020 with a sense of hope and optimism. Our positivity is based on our work ethos, our passion for innovation and our openness to sharing our technological know-how with the rest of the world. In 2020 we shall continue working hard to take Espressif’s AIoT solutions to the next level. Our intention is to remain at the forefront of technological evolution.

Other topics you can read in this month’s newsletter include:

- an impact analysis of a recent fault injection attack on ESP32 and the immediate action Espressif took to secure its SoCs even further;
- the recent Bluetooth LE 5.0 certification of ESP32, which has given our chip greater stability and compatibility;
- the recent qualification of ESP-EYE, ESP32-WROOM-32S and ESP32-SOLO-1 for Amazon:FreeRTOS.

## ESP32 Fault Injection Vulnerability — Impact Analysis

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*e4KAl1DI4dpsApbU.jpg)

Security researchers have recently described a fault injection attack on ESP32, which may result in some security compromise and unintended disclosure of information. However, [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview)’s security design remains safe for the vast majority of our products. Click on the link below to learn how.
