Hi everyone,

Espressif is proud to [announce](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_AWS_IoT_ExpressLink) the availability of new Wi-Fi modules implementing the AWS IoT ExpressLink specification.

Espressif’s AWS IoT ExpressLink modules, [ESP32-C3-MINI-1-N4-A](https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h00000E2JnNEAV/ESP32-C3-AWS-IoT-ExpressLink-Module), are based on the ESP32-C3 SoC and offer Wi-Fi + Bluetooth LE 5.0 connectivity, thus providing any host MCUs with out-of-the-box, seamless, AWS cloud connectivity. Espressif’s AWS IoT ExpressLink modules offer a simple serial interface which the host MCU uses to get connected to AWS IoT services, and transform any offline product into a cloud-connected product. Espressif’s AWS IoT ExpressLink Module handles complex, yet undifferentiated, workload, such as authentication, device management, connectivity, messaging and OTA. Thus, it relieves developers from developing and maintaining complex firmware, while it provides end-to-end security and fleet management at scale. Espressif’s AWS IoT ExpressLink module comes pre-programmed with qualified firmware, and pre-provisioned with unique device certificates that remove security concerns from the manufacturing process, which is, therefore, significantly simplified.

Espressif’s AWS IoT ExpressLink module, ESP32-C3-MINI-1-N4-A, has the [ESP32-C3 SoC](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c3) at its core, which provides a cost-effective connectivity solution with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE 5.0 support. This Espressif SoC ensures connection security with such features as secure boot, flash encryption and an integrated digital signature peripheral. Espressif’s AWS IoT ExpressLink module comes in a small form-factor of just 13.2mm x 16.6 mm, and offers the option of either a PCB antenna or an external antenna connector. The module comes with regulatory certifications for most of the world’s regions.
