Hi everyone,

Summer is getting hotter by the day here in Shanghai, but it seems that the only effect it is having is our steaming ahead with __a new series of chips based on ESP8285__ . The already existing version of ESP8285 features complete and self-contained Wi-Fi networking capabilities, fast switching between sleep and wakeup modes, adaptive radio biasing, advance signal processing, spur cancelation and RF co-existence, to mention only a few of its sophisticated characteristics.

In addition to these, the two new variants in the ESP8285 series will have different memory capacities and operating temperatures, in order to cater for as many application scenarios as possible. The first variant to be released in late August 2019 is __ESP8285H16__ , with a __2 MB__ memory and an operating temperature that ranges from __-40°C to +105°C__ . The other variant is __ESP8285H08__ , with a __1 MB__ memory, operating from __-40°C to +105°C__ . Stay tuned to get all the details about our new ESP8285 variants in August!

On a different note, as many of you probably know already, [ESP-Jumpstart](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP_Jumpstart) is Espressif’s reference guide that is based on the [IoT Development Framework, ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf). The aim of this guide is to help developers convert their ideas into actual products as quickly as possible. The guide itself was released in April 2019, but last month the first [ESP-Jumpstart training](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-jumpstart/en/latest/introduction.html)____ for University students took place in Espressif’s headquarters in Shanghai, at Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park.

This training was part of Espressif’s outreach program which aims to disseminate knowledge of AIoT technologies to top University students from across China. Led by Espressif engineers, this 16-hour training was offered to 9 students from __Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai University, East China Normal University__  and __ESIGELEC ROUEN University__ .

The participants used [ESP32-DevKitC](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-devkitc/overview) to build their own IoT demos and WeChat mini-programs for controlling smart devices. After due deliberation the Espressif engineers who led this training program awarded the best student of the cohort a prize which consisted of a __CNY 5,000 stipend and an internship at Espressif Systems__ . That said, the benefits of this program were not restricted only to the prize winner. The knowledge that all participants acquired and the skills they honed during this training has helped them to significantly improve their graduation projects. Other news you can read in this month’s newsletter include:

- Espressif’s impressive debut on the Sci-Tech Innovation Board of Shanghai’s Stock Exchange, on July 22nd, which was celebrated with a glorious gala later on the same day;
- Espressif’s new Module Pre-provisioning Services (MPS), which will enable customers to reduce manufacturing complexities and time to market;
- Espressif’s partner, DFRobot, which -offering several products based on ESP32 and ESP8266- has become a world-leading provider of robotics and open-source hardware;
- ESPcopter, which is a unique ESP8266-based, small-sized drone that is wirelessly networkable, interactive and programmable.
