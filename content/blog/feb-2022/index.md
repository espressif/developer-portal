Hi everyone,

[Version 4.4](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/tag/v4.4) of Espressif’s IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF v4.4) has recently been released, adding full support for the [ESP32-S3 SoC](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3) and preliminary support for the [ESP32-H2 SoC](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-H2_Thread_and_Zigbee_certified).

The purpose of [ESP-IDF](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf) has always been to create a simple, easy-to-use, open-source development environment which helps users take full advantage of the powerful hardware and software solutions that Espressif offers. Thus, ESP-IDF integrates real-time operating systems, peripheral drivers, network protocol stacks, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, program libraries, and development tools, while being accompanied by copious documentation, examples of use cases, and other relevant resources. As a result, there are already millions of Espressif IoT devices in use across the whole wide world.

Espressif is committed to constantly enhancing the capabilities of its software and hardware solutions. On this note, Teo Swee Ann, Founder and CEO of Espressif Systems, said: “Although innovation often begins with bursts of creativity and inspiration, it eventually comes to fruition after sustained hard work, perseverance and well-coordinated team work. This is the kind of work that our R&D team performs, always aiming at constant improvement. We attach great importance to user experience and, therefore, we continuously collect developer feedback, we evaluate it, and we optimize our products, solutions and services accordingly”. ESP-IDF is now a mature platform, with a rigorous release process and a strong support strategy, which ensures software stability and hassle-free mass production. If you have any suggestions for ESP-IDF, please give us your feedback via the [ESP32 forum](https://www.esp32.com/viewforum.php?f=13) or the [ESP-IDF GitHub repository](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues).
