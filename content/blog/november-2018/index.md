Welcome to our November Newsletter

Hi everyone,

November has already started, but we’re still in a __Halloween__  mood. Luckily it’s not just us! Tricksters and treaters were not simply carving pumpkins and wearing spooky outfits on October 31st. They were also using [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) to make their Halloween costumes even more horrifying!

What’s scarier than a pair of __Uncanny Eyes__ ? Well, the obvious answer is *five* pairs of Uncanny Eyes mounted on skulls and controlled in a way that makes everyone scream. Laurent did exactly that and posted the project on [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/laurentr/halloween-skull-costume-with-uncanny-eyes-on-esp32-376a13). Powered by [ESP32-DevKitC](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-devkitc/overview), Uncanny Eyes achieve maximum effect when they are attached to the bust of a Halloween skull costume. The wearer of the costume seamlessly controls the uncanny eyes, as they transition from random motion to coordinated movements via a hidden device with an analog joystick and buttons.

Apart from Halloween, what kept us excited last month was the release of __ESP-WHO__ , which is __Espressif’s face detection and recognition platform based on__ [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview). You will find ESP-WHO to be most helpful if, for example, you want to build a

coffee machine which will be able to recognize your face when using it, so that it gives you the kind of coffee that matches your taste; or when you want to control a home appliance that will shut down automatically upon recognizing that unsupervised children are in the vicinity. If you want to learn more about ESP-WHO, click on [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who).

Other news you can find in this month’s newsletter includes Espressif’s representation at the __IoT/M2M Expo__  in Japan, which took place on October 24–26; __“Bob”__ , a French mini dishwasher powered by ESP32; the __Hackaday Super-conference__  which takes place in Pasadena on November 2–4, featuring Espressif’s Software and Technical Marketing Manager, __Jeroen Domburg__ , as an invited speaker; and, finally, the continuing __ESP32 Bug Bounty Program__ .

Hope you enjoy reading the November edition of our newsletter.

“Throw in the sponge. Adopt Bob!” This is the motto of [Daan.Tech](http://daan.tech/), a French start-up whose goal is to usher in a new era of smart home appliances. Bob is a newly-designed ultra-compact dishwasher which offers the ultimate solution for people with space-constrained kitchens and an irreversible aversion to washing dishes by hand. Needless to say, of course, that “Bob” is built around Espressif’s powerful [ESP32-WROOM-32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp-wroom-32/overview) module, which can bring to life a variety of projects, ranging from low-power sensor networks to the most demanding tasks.

Do you like searching for security bugs? Do you want to earn some extra cash? Are you a fan of Espressif Systems and ESP32? If the answer to all these questions is positive, then you should definitely consider participating in our bug-reporting program, the [ESP32 Security Bug Bounty](https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1572&p=7266)! We had a similar program about ESP8266, which lasted from March 2015 until July 2018. Our ESP32 Bug Bounty started in March 2017 and is still on!
