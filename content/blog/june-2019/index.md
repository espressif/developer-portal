Hi everyone,

Celebrating the [Dragon Boat Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival) on 7–9 June is not the only reason we feel energetic and refreshed this week. More importantly, our new chip, ESP32-S2, will soon come out, as we have [recently announced](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/espressif-announces-%E2%80%A8esp32-s2-secure-wi-fi-mcu).

ESP32-S2 is a highly integrated, low-power microcontroller supporting 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi HT40 and having 43 GPIOs. Our new chip is based on an Xtensa single-core 32-bit LX7 processor that can be clocked up to 240MHz. With state-of-the-art power management, RF performance, IO capabilities and security features, ESP32-S2 is an ideal choice for smart-home applications, wearables and a wide variety of other IoT applications. In fact, the 240 MHz Xtensa core makes ESP32-S2 an optimal solution for building the most demanding IoT projects without requiring external MCUs.

By leveraging Espressif’s mature and production-ready IoT development framework (ESP-IDF), ESP32-S2 achieves excellent value for money, thus bringing faster and more secure IoT solutions to the market.

Engineering samples of the beta version of ESP32-S2 will become available towards the end of June 2019. For more information, please contact Espressif’s [Business Support Department](https://www.espressif.com/en/company/contact/pre-sale-questions-crm).

Other news you can read in this month’s newsletter include:

- the official inclusion of our ESP32-Azure IoT Kit in Microsoft’s Plug-and-Play program, which aims to bring extra ease to connecting IoT devices.
- a great event that AWS and Espressif put together on 4 June for the IoT community in the USA, which was about the development of IoT solutions.
- Espressif’s sponsorship of Pycom’s #GOINVENT worldwide series of workshops.
- a really cool project posted on hackster.io, which shows how you can create 8-bit tunes, using an ESP8266 development board.

Espressif’s [ESP32-Azure IoT Kit](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-azure-kit) has been granted a certification that makes it an integral part of [Microsoft’s Plug-and-Play program](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-iot-at-build-making-iot-solutions-easier-to-develop-more-powerful-to-use/), which has been designed to bring the ease of “Plug and Play” to IoT devices. With Microsoft’s Plug and Play, developers can plug virtually any peripheral into a Windows PC without having to worry about drivers.
