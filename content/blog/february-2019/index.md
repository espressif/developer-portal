Welcome to our February Newsletter

__*Our News. Our World Join Us!*__ 

Hi everyone,

Today is New Year’s Day, according to the lunar calendar, which we follow here in China. The lunar year from 5 February 2019 until 24 January 2020 is considered to be the year of the pig, which is the twelfth animal in the Chinese horoscope and is regarded as a symbol of wealth and good fortune. On this note, then, we would like to wish you all “新年快乐”, which is transliterated as “xīnnián kuàilè” and translated as Happy New Year!

In mid-January, between the Chinese and Western New Year’s Day we spent a weekend in Chongming Island, where we held our annual gathering as a company. On this picturesque island at the mouth of Yangtze River in Eastern China, Espressifers from all our offices across China, Europe and India gathered to contemplate the company’s course in 2018 and discuss its goals for 2019. We spoke about our mission to build bridges between the wider public and technology, particularly in the domains of Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things. As a company driving today’s AI and IoT revolution, Espressif Systems will continue supporting research in these fields through investments and partnerships with scholars and institutions whose mission is to promote STEM education in China and beyond.

Other topics you can find in this month’s newsletter include:

- [ESP-EYE](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp-eye/overview), Espressif’s newly-released development board for applications relating to Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things (AIoT);
- an announcement of the recent [Bluetooth SIG certification](https://launchstudio.bluetooth.com/ListingDetails/76255) for our ESP BLE Mesh SDK which will be released very soon;
- [the new “washMaster”](https://www.schulthess.ch/en/apartment-blocks/the-new-washmaster), a cutting-edge laundry machine based on Espressif’s powerful ESP32, which has been developed by Schulthess Maschinen AG in Switzerland; and, last but not least,
- the exciting [one-day event, dedicated to ESP32](https://www.facebook.com/events/357123601778174/), which took place in Bangkok last weekend, attracting a large number of makers from all around the country, and highlighting the huge popularity of ESP32 in Thailand.
