Hi everyone,

You might remember that a rather short while ago we launched [ESP RainMaker](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP-RainMaker), Espressif’s end-to-end platform which enables makers to realize their IoT ideas faster and without the hassle of managing the infrastructure involved in this process. Today, we are pleased to announce that we have recently added a number of features to this platform. So, ESP RainMaker now supports ESP32 too, on top of ESP32-S2, with which our end-to-end platform was initially launched. It also supports BLE-based Wi-Fi provisioning for ESP32. Another new feature is the recently-released, third-party voice integrations with Alexa and Google Voice Assistant skills, which enable your ESP RainMaker-based devices to be controlled with voice commands.

Furthermore, the newly-introduced support for [OTA firmware upgrades](https://rainmaker.espressif.com/docs/ota.html) will allow you to remotely upgrade the firmware of your devices by using the ESP RainMaker command line interface. We have also released resources for [Android](https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker-ios) smartphone applications, so that you can customize your projects as per your requirements. Finally, a VSCode extension with which you can control ESP RainMaker-based devices is also available now. Stay tuned for more ESP RainMaker features that are [coming up](https://rainmaker.espressif.com/docs/what-next.html) shortly!

Another piece of news I would like to highlight is Espressif’s first quarterly donation to The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™. This year we started a [wildlife protection program](https://www.espressif.com/en/company/corporate-responsibility/wildlife-protection-program), in an effort to raise public awareness of the current climate crisis and the natural habitat’s encroachment by humans in recent decades. In July 2020, we donated to The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™ the proceeds from the three development boards included in this initiative so far:

[ESP32-Vaquita-DSPG](https://github.com/espressif/esp-va-sdk/blob/master/docs/en/hw-reference/esp32/user-guide-esp32-vaquita-dspg.md), [ESP32-S2-Saola-1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/hw-reference/esp32s2/user-guide-saola-1-v1.2.html), and [ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits).

So, we would like to extend a heartfelt “thank you” to all the developers who have purchased the above-mentioned products and made our first donation possible. We greatly appreciate your contribution to our wildlife protection program and we look forward to welcoming more and more supporters in the future!
