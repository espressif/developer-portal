Welcome to the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF) workshop!

## About this workshop

On this workshop, you will have an introduction to the ESP-IDF development using the Espressif IDE and the ESP32-C6. From the IDE installation, you will be guided to setup your system, create the first project, build, flash and debug.

After the initial steps, you will be guided on how to use the components, blink the addressable RGB LED, work with the SDK configuration, connect to the WiFi network and finally, explore the low-power features on the ESP32-C6.

> This workshop is not limited to the ESP32-C6, however, some of the features explored on this workshop is only available on this SoC.

This workshop will be divided in 7 different assignments. Please see the workshop agenda below:

### Agenda

Throughout this workshop, we will explore several key topics with hands-on assignments to deepen your understanding of the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF) and the ESP32-C6 System on Chip (SoC).

We will start with an introduction to ESP-IDF, providing a foundation for using this powerful development framework. We then moved on to an introduction to the ESP32-C6, highlighting its capabilities and features.

- [ESP-IDF introduction](introduction)
- [Assignment 1: Installing the Espressif IDE](assignment-1)
- [Assignment 2: Creating a new project with Components](assignment-2)
- [Assignment 3: Connecting to WiFi](assignment-3)
- [Assignment 4: Working with the NVS](assignment-4)
- [Assignment 5: WiFi provisioning (EXTRA)](assignment-5)
- [Assignment 6: Protocols](assignment-6)
- [Assignment 7: Using the LP core](assignment-7)

The practical assignments covers a range of essential skills:

- **Assignment 1**: Installing the Espressif IDE, ensuring we have the necessary tools to start development.
- **Assignment 2**: Creating a new project with Components, teaching us how to structure and manage our projects effectively.
- **Assignment 3**: Connecting to WiFi, a crucial step for many IoT applications.
- **Assignment 4**: Working with the NVS (Non-Volatile Storage), allowing us to manage persistent data.
- **Assignment 5 (EXTRA)**: WiFi provisioning, providing insights into setting up and configuring WiFi networks.
- **Assignment 6 (EXTRA)**: Protocols, where we explored various communication protocols supported by the ESP32-C6, including the implementation of the TSL certificate bundle for secure communications.
- **Assignment 7**: Using the LP core, demonstrating how to utilize the low-power core for efficient energy management.

By participating in this workshop, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the ESP32-C6 SoC and the ESP-IDF, and how they can be leveraged to build efficient and powerful IoT applications. We hope this knowledge will serve as a solid foundation for your future projects.

Thank you for your time and engagement in this workshop. We look forward to seeing the innovative solutions youâ€™ll create with the ESP32-C6 SoC and the ESP-IDF.
