## Assignment 1: Install the Espressif-IDE

---

To get started and perform all the workshop assignments, you need to install the [Espressif-IDE](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/releases/tag/v3.0.0). This IDE will be used to create the project, flash and debug the code.

> As an alternative, you can use the VS Code extension for ESP-IDF or you can use the Command-Line-Interface (CLI) directly, however, this workshop is based on the Espressif-IDE and all the assignments will follow the steps using this IDE.

### Install the Espressif-IDE

This assignment will be done by the following tutorial: [Getting Started with IDEs Workshop](../../espressif-ide/).

You will need to:

- Install all the necessary drivers for Windows
- Install the Espressif-IDE
- Install ESP-IDF
- Create the first project
- Build
- Flash
- Debug

## Next step

Now that you know how to use Espressif-IDE, let's get started with ESP-IDF and create a project based on the components.
