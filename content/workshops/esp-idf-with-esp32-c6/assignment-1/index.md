## Assignment 1: Installing the Espressif IDE

---

To get started and perform all the workshop assignments, you will need to install the [Espressif IDE](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/releases/tag/v3.0.0). This IDE will be used to create the project, flash and debug the code.

> As alternative, you can use the VSCode extension for ESP-IDF or you can do directly by the Command-Line-Interface (CLI), however, this workshop is based on the Espressif IDE and all the assignments will follow the steps using this IDE.

### Installing the ESP-IDE

This assignment will be done by the following tutorial: [Getting Started with IDEs Workshop](../../espressif-ide/).

You will need to:

- Install all the necessary drivers for Windows
- Install the Espressif IDE
- Install the ESP-IDF
- Create the first project
- Build
- Flash
- Debug

## Next step

Now that you know how to use the Espressif IDE, let's get started with the ESP-IDF and create a project based on the components.
