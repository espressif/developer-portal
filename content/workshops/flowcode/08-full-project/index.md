If you have got this far then well done. You will have learned a
lot about embedded programming, about developing apps for
mobile devices and about electronics in general. You have
learned the basics of how to construct all the individual
elements of the system. Its up to you now to complete it.
What we have done is completed the project for you so that
you can refer to it when you get stuck. There are two final files:
“7 - Connecting to web FE.fcfx” and “7 - Connecting to web
FWD.fcfx”.
Over to you:
You have all the bones of the system in place. To get to the
final design you need to do the following:
Design all the individual screen graphics. Refer to the Planning
    section for details of the graphics, colours, fonts etc. We
    suggest that you embed the graphic of the menus needed
    onto your Embedded program panel so it looks like this:

Get the navigation between screens working properly.
Get the logic for a successful combination to be entered
   properly in place.
Get the communication between the Mobile phone and the
   M5Stack Dial working properly.

This is a great creative challenge. We suggest that you alter
the Embedded program panel to look like this:

Good luck and have fun!
