## Effort

{{< alert icon="mug-hot">}}
**This set of workshops will take around 20 hours to complete.**
{{< /alert >}}

## Requirements

You will need:
- M5Stack Dial with power lead
- Relay board - can be 12 or 24V
- Grove style 4 pin push leads
- Solenoid


If you are implementing the door lock for real you will also need:
- Maglock
- 12 or 24V power supply
- 5V regulator board (for powering the M5Stack Dial)

You will also need a copy of Flowcode with the ESP32 chip
pack. Flowcode is free of charge for makers, professionals will
need to buy a Pro license.

The ESP chip pack costs Â£60 or around $80 and is available
from the Flowcode web site: www.flowcode.co.uk.

## Learning outcomes

This workshop is designed for engineers who have some
experience of programming embedded systems and want to
learn more about graphical display based systems and web
based control and data gathering systems.
For Matrix customers it assumes that you have completed the
Introduction to Microcontrollers course.
If you complete the exercises in this workbook then it will take
you around 20 hours. This is designed for self study.

If you complete this workshop then will learn:
- ESP32 programming
- Simple Input / Output pin control
- How encoders work
- How I2C sensors work
- SHT32 temperature humidity sensor operation
- How solenoid/maglocks work
- Graphical display programming
- Menu system design for graphical displays
- Embedded web based communication techniques
- Mobile phone app development
- Mobile phone / Embedded system design

Whilst this project uses the M5Stack Dial the silks learned will
be useful for any graphical display based project.
