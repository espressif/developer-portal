Ok - let’s be honest. Planning is a bit of a pain. Its boring. Its
not the fun part of the job. At the start of a project we are
itching to get on with the coding, the graphics and get
something working.

But if you don’t plan then there can be all sorts of pain later:
you end up redoing work, falling out with colleagues and
customers, and it’s a lot less fun later on in the project.
