For now, the Contribution Guide offers the following materials:

- [Contribution workflow](contrib-workflow "Contribution workflow")
- [Writing content](writing-content "Writing content")

These workflows might be applicable partially or fully to the [contribution scenarios](#contribution-scenarios).

## Contribution Scenarios

You, dear members of the community, are very welcome to collaborate on the portal and contribute in any way. Some of the possible scenarios are:

<!-- no toc -->
- [Contribute original content](#contribute-original-content)
- [Request articles and initiate discussions](#request-articles-and-initiate-discussions)
- [Leave comments about existing content](#leave-comments-about-existing-content)
- [Improve infrastructure and functionality](#improve-infrastructure-and-functionality)


### Contribute original content

You can [contribute][contribution-guide] the content directly or indirectly related to Espressif products and solutions. For example, you can contribute articles or tutorials that facilitate learning or articles about your projects based on Espressif products.

After a review from Espressif technical editors, this content will be published in the author's name. The review is mainly needed to make sure that the content fits the purpose of the Espressif Developer Portal and follows the [Espressif Manual of Style][].

As a result, the author will become an _Espressif Developer Portal contributor_!

### Request articles and initiate discussions

In the past, if you had questions about certain wider subjects, your best bet would be to create an issue on [GitHub][github-org] or ask a question on the [ESP32 forum][esp32-forum]. Accordingly, you would usually get help regarding a specific issue, because in-depth explanations are not a thing in such places.

[github-org]: https://github.com/espressif
[esp32-forum]: https://esp32.com

Now if you want to know more about certain subjects or functionalities of Espressif products and solutions insufficiently covered in other places, or if you simply want to discuss anything related to Espressif, you can do it all through the Developer Portal's [discussions][developer-portal discussions] on GitHub.

[developer-portal discussions]: https://github.com/espressif/developer-portal/discussions

Depending on the number of requests for articles, more in-depth explanations, how-to guides, or tutorials, the requests might need to be prioritized through voting, then the content will be created and published accordingly.


### Leave comments about existing content

Another way for you to contribute is to leave comments with constructive criticism of the content, indication of typos or pointing out other issues. The content will be updated accordingly to make the user experience as smooth and efficient as possible.


### Improve infrastructure and functionality

The Espressif Developer Portal is a static website created with [Hugo][] and hosted on [GitHub][Developer Portal README]. If you want to propose improvements or use certain functionality in your content that is not yet implemented on the portal, you are very welcome to create a discussion to agree on the details. It will be even better if you can offer a pull request yourself.
