## Explore Embedded Swift on ESP32 at Do iOS 2024

Espressif Systems will be part of [Do iOS 2024](https://do-ios.com/), one of Europe's leading iOS developer conferences, where [Juraj Mich√°lek](https://developer.espressif.com/authors/juraj-michalek/) will be giving a talk titled Embedded Swift: Using Your Swift Skills for Embedded Development.

### When & Where

üìÖ Talk: November 13
üìç Location: [Nemo Science Museum, Oosterdok 2, 1011 VX Amsterdam](http://maps.apple.com/?address=Oosterdok+2+Amsterdam&q=NEMO+Science+Museum)

The session will introduce developers to the possibilities of using [Swift on ESP32 microcontrollers](https://developer.espressif.com/tags/swift/), focusing on the RISC-V [ESP32-C, ESP32-H, and ESP32-P families](https://products.espressif.com/). Swift‚Äôs compatibility with C makes it an appealing alternative to languages like [C](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), [Rust](https://github.com/esp-rs), and [MicroPython](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html), enabling developers to work with mature libraries and explore new protocols such as Matter.

### What You'll Learn

- How Swift integrates with ESP32 microcontrollers for embedded development.
- Practical aspects of working with ESP32-C, ESP32-H, and ESP32-P devices.
- Guidance on getting started with Swift on ESP32 platforms, expanding your development toolkit.

This talk is ideal for developers looking to bring their iOS and Swift skills into the embedded world, leveraging the capabilities of ESP32 for a range of applications.
